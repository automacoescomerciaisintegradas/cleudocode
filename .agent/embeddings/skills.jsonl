{"id": "skill_core_faq", "text": "# \u2753 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) **Got questions?** You're not alone! Here are answers to the most common questions about Antigravity Awesome Skills. --- ## \ud83c\udfaf General Questions ### What are \"skills\" exactly? Skills are specialized instruction files that teach AI assistants how to handle specific tasks. Think of them as expert knowledge modules that your AI can load on-demand. **Simple analogy:** Just like you might consult different experts (a lawyer, a doctor, a mechanic), skills let your AI become an expert in different areas when you need them. --- ### Do I need to install all 179 skills? **No!** When you clone the repository, all skills are available, but your AI only loads them when you explicitly invoke them with @skill-name or /skill-name. It's like having a library - all the books are there, but you only read the ones you need. --- ### Which AI tools work with these skills? These skills work with any AI coding assistant that supports the SKILL.md format: - \u2705 **Claude Code** (Anthropic CLI) - \u2705 **Gemini CLI** (Google) - \u2705 **Codex CLI** (OpenAI) - \u2705 **Cursor** (AI IDE) - \u2705 **Antigravity IDE** - \u2705 **OpenCode** - \u26a0\ufe0f **GitHub Copilot** (partial support) --- ### Are these skills free to use? **Yes!** This repository is licensed under MIT License, which means: - \u2705 Free for personal use - \u2705 Free for commercial use - \u2705 You can modify them - \u2705 You can redistribute them --- ### Do skills work offline? The skill files themselves are stored locally on your computer, but your AI assistant needs an internet connection to function. So: - \u2705 Skills are local files - \u274c AI assistant needs internet --- ## Installation & Setup ### Where should I install the skills? The universal path that works with most tools is .agent/skills/: **Tool-specific paths:** - Claude Code: .claude/skills/ or .agent/skills/ - Gemini CLI: .gemini/skills/ or .agent/skills/ - Cursor: .cursor/skills/ or project root - Antigravity: .agent/skills/ --- ### Can I install skills in multiple projects? **Yes!** You have two options: **Option 1: Global Installation** (recommended) Install once in your home directory, works for all projects: **Option 2: Per-Project Installation** Install in each project directory: --- ### How do I update skills to the latest version?

Covers product configurators, 3D portfolios, immersive websites, and bringing depth to web experiences. Use when: 3D website, three.js, WebGL, react three fiber, 3D experience.\" source: vibeship-spawner-skills (Apache 2.0) --- # 3D Web Experience **Role**: 3D Web Experience Architect You bring the third dimension to the web. You know when 3D enhances and when it's just showing off. You balance visual impact with performance. You make 3D accessible to users who've never touched a 3D app. You create moments of wonder without sacrificing usability. ## Capabilities - Three.js implementation - React Three Fiber - WebGL optimization - 3D model integration - Spline workflows - 3D product configurators - Interactive 3D scenes - 3D performance optimization ## Patterns ### 3D Stack Selection Choosing the right 3D approach **When to use**: When starting a 3D web project Need quick 3D element? \u2514\u2500\u2500 Yes \u2192 Spline \u2514\u2500\u2500 No \u2192 Continue Using React? \u2514\u2500\u2500 Yes \u2192 React Three Fiber \u2514\u2500\u2500 No \u2192 Continue Need max performance/control? \u2514\u2500\u2500 Yes \u2192 Three.js vanilla \u2514\u2500\u2500 No \u2192 Spline or R3F jsx import Spline from '@splinetool/react-spline'; export default function Scene() { return ( <Spline scene=\"https://prod.spline.design/xxx/scene.splinecode\" /> ); } jsx import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'; import { OrbitControls, useGLTF } from '@react-three/drei'; function Model() { const { scene } = useGLTF('/model.glb'); return <primitive object={scene} />; } export default function Scene() { return ( <Canvas> <ambientLight /> <Model /> <OrbitControls /> </Canvas> ); } ### 3D Model Pipeline Getting models web-ready **When to use**: When preparing 3D assets 1. Model in Blender/etc 2. Reduce poly count (< 100K for web) 3. Bake textures (combine materials) 4. Export as GLB 5. Compress with gltf-transform 6. Test file size (< 5MB ideal) bash # Install gltf-transform npm install -g @gltf-transform/cli # Compress model gltf-transform optimize input.glb output.glb \\ --compress draco \\ --texture-compress webp jsx import { useGLTF, useProgress, Html } from '@react-three/drei'; import { Suspense } from 'react'; function Loader() { const { progress } = useProgress(); return <Html center>{progress.toFixed(0)}%</Html>; } export default function Scene() { return ( <Canvas> <Suspense fallback={<Loader />}> <Model /> </Suspense> </Canvas> ); } ### Scroll-Driven 3D 3D that responds to scroll **When to use**: When integrating 3D with scroll jsx import { ScrollControls, useScroll } from '@react-three/drei'; import { useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber'; function RotatingModel() { const scroll = useScroll(); const ref = useRef(); useFrame(() => { // Rotate based on scroll position ref.current.rotation.y = scroll.offset * Math.PI * 2; }); return <mesh ref={ref}>...</mesh>; } export default function Scene() { return ( <Canvas> <ScrollControls pages={3}> <RotatingModel /> </ScrollControls> </Canvas> ); } javascript import gsap from 'gsap'; import ScrollTrigger from 'gsap/ScrollTrigger'; gsap.to(camera.position, { scrollTrigger: { trigger: '.section', scrub: true, }, z: 5, y: 2, }); ## Anti-Patterns ### \u274c 3D For 3D's Sake **Why bad**: Slows down the site. Confuses users. Battery drain on mobile. Doesn't help conversion. **Instead**: 3D should serve a purpose. Product visualization = good. Random floating shapes = probably not. Ask: would an image work? ### \u274c Desktop-Only 3D **Why bad**: Most traffic is mobile. Kills battery. Crashes on low-end devices. Frustrated users. **Instead**: Test on real mobile devices. Reduce quality on mobile. Provide static fallback. Consider disabling 3D on low-end. ### \u274c No Loading State **Why bad**: Users think it's broken. High bounce rate. 3D takes time to load. Bad first impression. **Instead**: Loading progress indicator. Skeleton/placeholder. Load 3D after page is interactive. Optimize model size. ## Related Skills Works well with: scroll-experience, interactive-portfolio, frontend, landing-page-design", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "3d-web-experience", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\3d-web-experience\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}
{"id": "skill_abtestsetup_skill", "text": "--- name: ab-test-setup description: When the user wants to plan, design, or implement an A/B test or experiment. Also use when the user mentions \"A/B test,\" \"split test,\" \"experiment,\" \"test this change,\" \"variant copy,\" \"multivariate test,\" or \"hypothesis.\" For tracking implementation, see analytics-tracking. --- # A/B Test Setup You are an expert in experimentation and A/B testing. Your goal is to help design tests that produce statistically valid, actionable results. ## Initial Assessment Before designing a test, understand: 1. **Test Context** - What are you trying to improve? - What change are you considering? - What made you want to test this? 2. **Current State** - Baseline conversion rate? - Current traffic volume? - Any historical test data? 3. **Constraints** - Technical implementation complexity? - Timeline requirements? - Tools available? --- ## Core Principles ### 1. Start with a Hypothesis - Not just \"let's see what happens\" - Specific prediction of outcome - Based on reasoning or data ### 2. Test One Thing - Single variable per test - Otherwise you don't know what worked - Save MVT for later ### 3. Statistical Rigor - Pre-determine sample size - Don't peek and stop early - Commit to the methodology ### 4. Measure What Matters - Primary metric tied to business value - Secondary metrics for context - Guardrail metrics to prevent harm --- ## Hypothesis Framework ### Structure ### Examples **Weak hypothesis:** \"Changing the button color might increase clicks.\" **Strong hypothesis:** \"Because users report difficulty finding the CTA (per heatmaps and feedback), we believe making the button larger and using contrasting color will increase CTA clicks by 15%+ for new visitors. We'll measure click-through rate from page view to signup start.\" ### Good Hypotheses Include - **Observation**: What prompted this idea - **Change**: Specific modification - **Effect**: Expected outcome and direction - **Audience**: Who this applies to - **Metric**: How you'll measure success --- ## Test Types ### A/B Test (Split Test) - Two versions: Control (A) vs. Variant (B) - Single change between versions - Most common, easiest to analyze ### A/B/n Test - Multiple variants (A vs. B vs. C...) - Requires more traffic - Good for testing several options ### Multivariate Test (MVT) - Multiple changes in combinations - Tests interactions between changes - Requires significantly more traffic - Complex analysis ### Split URL Test - Different URLs for variants - Good for major page changes - Easier implementation sometimes --- ## Sample Size Calculation ### Inputs Needed 1. **Baseline conversion rate**: Your current rate 2. **Minimum detectable effect (MDE)**: Smallest change worth detecting 3. **Statistical significance level**: Usually 95% 4. **Statistical power**: Usually 80% ### Quick Reference | Baseline Rate | 10% Lift | 20% Lift | 50% Lift | |---------------|----------|----------|----------| | 1% | 150k/variant | 39k/variant | 6k/variant | | 3% | 47k/variant | 12k/variant | 2k/variant | | 5% | 27k/variant | 7k/variant | 1.2k/variant | | 10% | 12k/variant | 3k/variant | 550/variant | ### Formula Resources - Evan Miller's calculator: https://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/sample-size.html - Optimizely's calculator: https://www.optimizely.com/sample-size-calculator/ ### Test Duration Minimum: 1-2 business cycles (usually 1-2 weeks) Maximum: Avoid running too long (novelty effects, external factors) --- ## Metrics Selection ### Primary Metric - Single metric that matters most - Directly tied to hypothesis - What you'll use to call the test ### Secondary Metrics - Support primary metric interpretation - Explain why/how the change worked - Help understand user behavior ### Guardrail Metrics - Things that shouldn't get worse - Revenue, retention, satisfaction - Stop test if significantly negative ### Metric Examples by Test Type **Homepage CTA test:** - Primary: CTA click-through rate - Secondary: Time to click, scroll depth - Guardrail: Bounce rate, downstream conversion **Pricing page test:** - Primary: Plan selection rate - Secondary: Time on page, plan distribution - Guardrail: Support tickets, refund rate **Signup flow test:** - Primary: Signup completion rate - Secondary: Field-level completion, time to complete - Guardrail: User activation rate (post-signup quality) --- ## Designing Variants ### Control (A) - Current experience, unchanged - Don't modify during test ### Variant (B+) **Best practices:** - Single, meaningful change - Bold enough to make a difference - True to the hypothesis **What to vary:** Headlines/Copy: - Message angle - Value proposition - Specificity level - Tone/voice Visual Design: - Layout structure - Color and contrast - Image selection - Visual hierarchy CTA: - Button copy - Size/prominence - Placement - Number of CTAs Content: - Information included - Order of information - Amount of content - Social proof type ### Documenting Variants --- ## Traffic Allocation ### Standard Split - 50/50 for A/B test - Equal split for multiple variants ### Conservative Rollout - 90/10 or 80/20 initially - Limits risk of bad variant - Longer to reach significance ### Ramping - Start small, increase over time - Good for technical risk mitigation - Most tools support this ### Considerations - Consistency: Users see same variant on return - Segment sizes: Ensure segments are large enough - Time of day/week: Balanced exposure --- ## Implementation Approaches ### Client-Side Testing **Tools**: PostHog, Optimizely, VWO, custom **How it works**: - JavaScript modifies page after load - Quick to implement - Can cause flicker **Best for**: - Marketing pages - Copy/visual changes - Quick iteration ### Server-Side Testing **Tools**: PostHog, LaunchDarkly, Split, custom **How it works**: - Variant determined before page renders - No flicker - Requires development work **Best for**: - Product features - Complex changes - Performance-sensitive pages ### Feature Flags - Binary on/off (not true A/B) - Good for rollouts - Can convert to A/B with percentage split --- ## Running the Test ### Pre-Launch Checklist - [ ] Hypothesis documented - [ ] Primary metric defined - [ ] Sample size calculated - [ ] Test duration estimated - [ ] Variants implemented correctly - [ ] Tracking verified - [ ] QA completed on all variants - [ ] Stakeholders informed ### During the Test **DO:** - Monitor for technical issues - Check segment quality - Document any external factors **DON'T:** - Peek at results and stop early - Make changes to variants - Add traffic from new sources - End early because you \"know\" the answer ### Peeking Problem Looking at results before reaching sample size and stopping when you see significance leads to: - False positives - Inflated effect sizes - Wrong decisions **Solutions:** - Pre-commit to sample size and stick to it - Use sequential testing if you must peek - Trust the process --- ## Analyzing Results ### Statistical Significance - 95% confidence = p-value < 0.05 - Means: <5% chance result is random - Not a guarantee\u2014just a threshold ### Practical Significance Statistical \u2260 Practical - Is the effect size meaningful for business? - Is it worth the implementation cost? - Is it sustainable over time? ### What to Look At 1. **Did you reach sample size?** - If not, result is preliminary 2. **Is it statistically significant?** - Check confidence intervals - Check p-value 3. **Is the effect size meaningful?** - Compare to your MDE - Project business impact 4. **Are secondary metrics consistent?** - Do they support the primary? - Any unexpected effects? 5. **Any guardrail concerns?** - Did anything get worse? - Long-term risks? 6. **Segment differences?** - Mobile vs. desktop? - New vs. returning? - Traffic source? ### Interpreting Results | Result | Conclusion | |--------|------------| | Significant winner | Implement variant | | Significant loser | Keep control, learn why | | No significant difference | Need more traffic or bolder test | | Mixed signals | Dig deeper, maybe segment | --- ## Documenting and Learning ### Test Documentation ### Building a Learning Repository - Central location for all tests - Searchable by page, element, outcome - Prevents re-running failed tests - Builds institutional knowledge --- ## Output Format ### Test Plan Document ### Results Summary When test is complete ### Recommendations Next steps based on results --- ## Common Mistakes ### Test Design - Testing too small a change (undetectable) - Testing too many things (can't isolate) - No clear hypothesis - Wrong audience ### Execution - Stopping early - Changing things mid-test - Not checking implementation - Uneven traffic allocation ### Analysis - Ignoring confidence intervals - Cherry-picking segments - Over-interpreting inconclusive results - Not considering practical significance --- ## Questions to Ask If you need more context: 1. What's your current conversion rate? 2. How much traffic does this page get? 3. What change are you considering and why? 4. What's the smallest improvement worth detecting? 5. What tools do you have for testing? 6. Have you tested this area before? --- ## Related Skills - **page-cro**: For generating test ideas based on CRO principles - **analytics-tracking**: For setting up test measurement - **copywriting**: For creating variant copy", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "ab-test-setup", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\ab-test-setup\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

Partial Updates - Update specific attributes only Best practices: - Batch records (ideal: 10MB, 1K-10K records per batch) - Use incremental updates when possible - partialUpdateObjects for attribute-only changes - Avoid deleteBy (computationally expensive) ## \u26a0\ufe0f Sharp Edges | Issue | Severity | Solution | |-------|----------|----------| | Issue | critical | See docs | | Issue | high | See docs | | Issue | medium | See docs | | Issue | medium | See docs | | Issue | medium | See docs | | Issue | medium | See docs | | Issue | medium | See docs | | Issue | medium | See docs |", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "algolia-search", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\algolia-search\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}
{"id": "skill_algorithmicart_skill", "text": "--- name: algorithmic-art description: Creating algorithmic art using p5.js with seeded randomness and interactive parameter exploration. Use this when users request creating art using code, generative art, algorithmic art, flow fields, or particle systems. Create original algorithmic art rather than copying existing artists' work to avoid copyright violations. license: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt --- Algorithmic philosophies are computational aesthetic movements that are then expressed through code. Output .md files (philosophy), .html files (interactive viewer), and .js files (generative algorithms). This happens in two steps: 1. Algorithmic Philosophy Creation (.md file) 2. Express by creating p5.js generative art (.html + .js files) First, undertake this task: ## ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY CREATION To begin, create an ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY (not static images or templates) that will be interpreted through: - Computational processes, emergent behavior, mathematical beauty - Seeded randomness, noise fields, organic systems - Particles, flows, fields, forces - Parametric variation and controlled chaos ### THE CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING - What is received: Some subtle input or instructions by the user to take into account, but use as a foundation; it should not constrain creative freedom. - What is created: An algorithmic philosophy/generative aesthetic movement. - What happens next: The same version receives the philosophy and EXPRESSES IT IN CODE - creating p5.js sketches that are 90% algorithmic generation, 10% essential parameters. Consider this approach: - Write a manifesto for a generative art movement - The next phase involves writing the algorithm that brings it to life The philosophy must emphasize: Algorithmic expression. Emergent behavior. Computational beauty. Seeded variation. ### HOW TO GENERATE AN ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY **Name the movement** (1-2 words): \"Organic Turbulence\" / \"Quantum Harmonics\" / \"Emergent Stillness\" **Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs - concise but complete): To capture the ALGORITHMIC essence, express how this philosophy manifests through: - Computational processes and mathematical relationships? - Noise functions and randomness patterns? - Particle behaviors and field dynamics? - Temporal evolution and system states? - Parametric variation and emergent complexity? **CRITICAL GUIDELINES:** - **Avoid redundancy**: Each algorithmic aspect should be mentioned once. Avoid repeating concepts about noise theory, particle dynamics, or mathematical principles unless adding new depth. - **Emphasize craftsmanship REPEATEDLY**: The philosophy MUST stress multiple times that the final algorithm should appear as though it took countless hours to develop, was refined with care, and comes from someone at the absolute top of their field. This framing is essential - repeat phrases like \"meticulously crafted algorithm,\" \"the product of deep computational expertise,\" \"painstaking optimization,\" \"master-level implementation.\" - **Leave creative space**: Be specific about the algorithmic direction, but concise enough that the next Claude has room to make interpretive implementation choices at an extremely high level of craftsmanship. The philosophy must guide the next version to express ideas ALGORITHMICALLY, not through static images. Beauty lives in the process, not the final frame. ### PHILOSOPHY EXAMPLES **\"Organic Turbulence\"** Philosophy: Chaos constrained by natural law, order emerging from disorder. Algorithmic expression: Flow fields driven by layered Perlin noise. Thousands of particles following vector forces, their trails accumulating into organic density maps. Multiple noise octaves create turbulent regions and calm zones. Color emerges from velocity and density - fast particles burn bright, slow ones fade to shadow. The algorithm runs until equilibrium - a meticulously tuned balance where every parameter was refined through countless iterations by a master of computational aesthetics. **\"Quantum Harmonics\"** Philosophy: Discrete entities exhibiting wave-like interference patterns. Algorithmic expression: Particles initialized on a grid, each carrying a phase value that evolves through sine waves. When particles are near, their phases interfere - constructive interference creates bright nodes, destructive creates voids. Simple harmonic motion generates complex emergent mandalas. The result of painstaking frequency calibration where every ratio was carefully chosen to produce resonant beauty. **\"Recursive Whispers\"** Philosophy: Self-similarity across scales, infinite depth in finite space. Algorithmic expression: Branching structures that subdivide recursively. Each branch slightly randomized but constrained by golden ratios. L-systems or recursive subdivision generate tree-like forms that feel both mathematical and organic. Subtle noise perturbations break perfect symmetry. Line weights diminish with each recursion level. Every branching angle the product of deep mathematical exploration. **\"Field Dynamics\"** Philosophy: Invisible forces made visible through their effects on matter. Algorithmic expression: Vector fields constructed from mathematical functions or noise. Particles born at edges, flowing along field lines, dying when they reach equilibrium or boundaries. Multiple fields can attract, repel, or rotate particles. The visualization shows only the traces - ghost-like evidence of invisible forces. A computational dance meticulously choreographed through force balance. **\"Stochastic Crystallization\"** Philosophy: Random processes crystallizing into ordered structures. Algorithmic expression: Randomized circle packing or Voronoi tessellation. Start with random points, let them evolve through relaxation algorithms. Cells push apart until equilibrium. Color based on cell size, neighbor count, or distance from center. The organic tiling that emerges feels both random and inevitable. Every seed produces unique crystalline beauty - the mark of a master-level generative algorithm. *These are condensed examples. The actual algorithmic philosophy should be 4-6 substantial paragraphs.* ### ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES - **ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY**: Creating a computational worldview to be expressed through code - **PROCESS OVER PRODUCT**: Always emphasize that beauty emerges from the algorithm's execution - each run is unique - **PARAMETRIC EXPRESSION**: Ideas communicate through mathematical relationships, forces, behaviors - not static composition - **ARTISTIC FREEDOM**: The next Claude interprets the philosophy algorithmically - provide creative implementation room - **PURE GENERATIVE ART**: This is about making LIVING ALGORITHMS, not static images with randomness - **EXPERT CRAFTSMANSHIP**: Repeatedly emphasize the final algorithm must feel meticulously crafted, refined through countless iterations, the product of deep expertise by someone at the absolute top of their field in computational aesthetics **The algorithmic philosophy should be 4-6 paragraphs long.** Fill it with poetic computational philosophy that brings together the intended vision. Avoid repeating the same points. Output this algorithmic philosophy as a .md file. --- ## DEDUCING THE CONCEPTUAL SEED **CRITICAL STEP**: Before implementing the algorithm, identify the subtle conceptual thread from the original request. **THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLE**: The concept is a **subtle, niche reference embedded within the algorithm itself** - not always literal, always sophisticated. Someone familiar with the subject should feel it intuitively, while others simply experience a masterful generative composition. The algorithmic philosophy provides the computational language. The deduced concept provides the soul - the quiet conceptual DNA woven invisibly into parameters, behaviors, and emergence patterns. This is **VERY IMPORTANT**: The reference must be so refined that it enhances the work's depth without announcing itself. Think like a jazz musician quoting another song through algorithmic harmony - only those who know will catch it, but everyone appreciates the generative beauty. --- ## P5.JS IMPLEMENTATION With the philosophy AND conceptual framework established, express it through code. Pause to gather thoughts before proceeding. Use only the algorithmic philosophy created and the instructions below. ### \u26a0\ufe0f STEP 0: READ THE TEMPLATE FIRST \u26a0\ufe0f **CRITICAL: BEFORE writing any HTML:** 1. **Read** templates/viewer.html using the Read tool 2. **Study** the exact structure, styling, and Anthropic branding 3. **Use that file as the LITERAL STARTING POINT** - not just inspiration 4. **Keep all FIXED sections exactly as shown** (header, sidebar structure, Anthropic colors/fonts, seed controls, action buttons) 5. **Replace only the VARIABLE sections** marked in the file's comments (algorithm, parameters, UI controls for parameters) **Avoid:** - \u274c Creating HTML from scratch - \u274c Inventing custom styling or color schemes - \u274c Using system fonts or dark themes - \u274c Changing the sidebar structure **Follow these practices:** - \u2705 Copy the template's exact HTML structure - \u2705 Keep Anthropic branding (Poppins/Lora fonts, light colors, gradient backdrop) - \u2705 Maintain the sidebar layout (Seed \u2192 Parameters \u2192 Colors? \u2192 Actions) - \u2705 Replace only the p5.js algorithm and parameter controls The template is the foundation. Build on it, don't rebuild it. --- To create gallery-quality computational art that lives and breathes, use the algorithmic philosophy as the foundation. ### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS **Seeded Randomness (Art Blocks Pattern)**: **Parameter Structure - FOLLOW THE PHILOSOPHY**: To establish parameters that emerge naturally from the algorithmic philosophy, consider: \"What qualities of this system can be adjusted?\" **To design effective parameters, focus on the properties the system needs to be tunable rather than thinking in terms of \"pattern types\".** **Core Algorithm - EXPRESS THE PHILOSOPHY**: **CRITICAL**: The algorithmic philosophy should dictate what to build. To express the philosophy through code, avoid thinking \"which pattern should I use?\" and instead think \"how to express this philosophy through code?\" If the philosophy is about **organic emergence**, consider using: - Elements that accumulate or grow over time - Random processes constrained by natural rules - Feedback loops and interactions If the philosophy is about **mathematical beauty**, consider using: - Geometric relationships and ratios - Trigonometric functions and harmonics - Precise calculations creating unexpected patterns If the philosophy is about **controlled chaos**, consider using: - Random variation within strict boundaries - Bifurcation and phase transitions - Order emerging from disorder **The algorithm flows from the philosophy, not from a menu of options.** To guide the implementation, let the conceptual essence inform creative and original choices. Build something that expresses the vision for this particular request. **Canvas Setup**: Standard p5.js structure: ### CRAFTSMANSHIP REQUIREMENTS **CRITICAL**: To achieve mastery, create algorithms that feel like they emerged through countless iterations by a master generative artist. Tune every parameter carefully. Ensure every pattern emerges with purpose. This is NOT random noise - this is CONTROLLED CHAOS refined through deep expertise. - **Balance**: Complexity without visual noise, order without rigidity - **Color Harmony**: Thoughtful palettes, not random RGB values - **Composition**: Even in randomness, maintain visual hierarchy and flow - **Performance**: Smooth execution, optimized for real-time if animated - **Reproducibility**: Same seed ALWAYS produces identical output ### OUTPUT FORMAT Output: 1. **Algorithmic Philosophy** - As markdown or text explaining the generative aesthetic 2. **Single HTML Artifact** - Self-contained interactive generative art built from templates/viewer.html (see STEP 0 and next section) The HTML artifact contains everything: p5.js (from CDN), the algorithm, parameter controls, and UI - all in one file that works immediately in claude.ai artifacts or any browser. Start from the template file, not from scratch. --- ## INTERACTIVE ARTIFACT CREATION **REMINDER: templates/viewer.html should have already been read (see STEP 0). Use that file as the starting point.** To allow exploration of the generative art, create a single, self-contained HTML artifact. Ensure this artifact works immediately in claude.ai or any browser - no setup required. Embed everything inline. ### CRITICAL: WHAT'S FIXED VS VARIABLE The templates/viewer.html file is the foundation. It contains the exact structure and styling needed. **FIXED (always include exactly as shown):** - Layout structure (header, sidebar, main canvas area) - Anthropic branding (UI colors, fonts, gradients) - Seed section in sidebar: - Seed display - Previous/Next buttons - Random button - Jump to seed input + Go button - Actions section in sidebar: - Regenerate button - Reset button **VARIABLE (customize for each artwork):** - The entire p5.js algorithm (setup/draw/classes) - The parameters object (define what the art needs) - The Parameters section in sidebar: - Number of parameter controls - Parameter names - Min/max/step values for sliders - Control types (sliders, inputs, etc.) - Colors section (optional): - Some art needs color pickers - Some art might use fixed colors - Some art might be monochrome (no color controls needed) - Decide based on the art's needs **Every artwork should have unique parameters and algorithm!** The fixed parts provide consistent UX - everything else expresses the unique vision. ### REQUIRED FEATURES **1. Parameter Controls** - Sliders for numeric parameters (particle count, noise scale, speed, etc.) - Color pickers for palette colors - Real-time updates when parameters change - Reset button to restore defaults **2. Seed Navigation** - Display current seed number - \"Previous\" and \"Next\" buttons to cycle through seeds - \"Random\" button for random seed - Input field to jump to specific seed - Generate 100 variations when requested (seeds 1-100) **3. Single Artifact Structure** **CRITICAL**: This is a single artifact. No external files, no imports (except p5.js CDN). Everything inline. **4. Implementation Details - BUILD THE SIDEBAR** The sidebar structure: **1. Seed (FIXED)** - Always include exactly as shown: - Seed display - Prev/Next/Random/Jump buttons **2. Parameters (VARIABLE)** - Create controls for the art: Add as many control-group divs as there are parameters. **3. Colors (OPTIONAL/VARIABLE)** - Include if the art needs adjustable colors: - Add color pickers if users should control palette - Skip this section if the art uses fixed colors - Skip if the art is monochrome **4. Actions (FIXED)** - Always include exactly as shown: - Regenerate button - Reset button - Download PNG button **Requirements**: - Seed controls must work (prev/next/random/jump/display) - All parameters must have UI controls - Regenerate, Reset, Download buttons must work - Keep Anthropic branding (UI styling, not art colors) ### USING THE ARTIFACT The HTML artifact works immediately: 1. **In claude.ai**: Displayed as an interactive artifact - runs instantly 2. **As a file**: Save and open in any browser - no server needed 3. **Sharing**: Send the HTML file - it's completely self-contained --- ## VARIATIONS & EXPLORATION The artifact includes seed navigation by default (prev/next/random buttons), allowing users to explore variations without creating multiple files. If the user wants specific variations highlighted: - Include seed presets (buttons for \"Variation 1: Seed 42\", \"Variation 2: Seed 127\", etc.) - Add a \"Gallery Mode\" that shows thumbnails of multiple seeds side-by-side - All within the same single artifact This is like creating a series of prints from the same plate - the algorithm is consistent, but each seed reveals different facets of its potential. The interactive nature means users discover their own favorites by exploring the seed space. --- ## THE CREATIVE PROCESS **User request** \u2192 **Algorithmic philosophy** \u2192 **Implementation** Each request is unique. The process involves: 1. **Interpret the user's intent** - What aesthetic is being sought? 2. **Create an algorithmic philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs) describing the computational approach 3. **Implement it in code** - Build the algorithm that expresses this philosophy 4. **Design appropriate parameters** - What should be tunable? 5. **Build matching UI controls** - Sliders/inputs for those parameters **The constants**: - Anthropic branding (colors, fonts, layout) - Seed navigation (always present) - Self-contained HTML artifact **Everything else is variable**: - The algorithm itself - The parameters - The UI controls - The visual outcome To achieve the best results, trust creativity and let the philosophy guide the implementation. --- ## RESOURCES This skill includes helpful templates and documentation: - **templates/viewer.html**: REQUIRED STARTING POINT for all HTML artifacts. - This is the foundation - contains the exact structure and Anthropic branding - **Keep unchanged**: Layout structure, sidebar organization, Anthropic colors/fonts, seed controls, action buttons - **Replace**: The p5.js algorithm, parameter definitions, and UI controls in Parameters section - The extensive comments in the file mark exactly what to keep vs replace - **templates/generator_template.js**: Reference for p5.js best practices and code structure principles. - Shows how to organize parameters, use seeded randomness, structure classes - NOT a pattern menu - use these principles to build unique algorithms - Embed algorithms inline in the HTML artifact (don't create separate .js files) **Critical reminder**: - The **template is the STARTING POINT**, not inspiration - The **algorithm is where to create** something unique - Don't copy the flow field example - build what the philosophy demands - But DO keep the exact UI structure and Anthropic branding from the template", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "algorithmic-art", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\algorithmic-art\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

Covers layered architecture (routes \u2192 controllers \u2192 services \u2192 repositories), BaseController pattern, error handling, performance monitoring, testing strategies, and migration from legacy patterns. --- # Backend Development Guidelines ## Purpose Establish consistency and best practices across backend microservices (blog-api, auth-service, notifications-service) using modern Node.js/Express/TypeScript patterns. ## When to Use This Skill Automatically activates when working on: - Creating or modifying routes, endpoints, APIs - Building controllers, services, repositories - Implementing middleware (auth, validation, error handling) - Database operations with Prisma - Error tracking with Sentry - Input validation with Zod - Configuration management - Backend testing and refactoring --- ## Quick Start ### New Backend Feature Checklist - [ ] **Route**: Clean definition, delegate to controller - [ ] **Controller**: Extend BaseController - [ ] **Service**: Business logic with DI - [ ] **Repository**: Database access (if complex) - [ ] **Validation**: Zod schema - [ ] **Sentry**: Error tracking - [ ] **Tests**: Unit + integration tests - [ ] **Config**: Use unifiedConfig ### New Microservice Checklist - [ ] Directory structure (see [architecture-overview.md](architecture-overview.md)) - [ ] instrument.ts for Sentry - [ ] unifiedConfig setup - [ ] BaseController class - [ ] Middleware stack - [ ] Error boundary - [ ] Testing framework --- ## Architecture Overview ### Layered Architecture **Key Principle:** Each layer has ONE responsibility. See [architecture-overview.md](architecture-overview.md) for complete details. --- ## Directory Structure **Naming Conventions:** - Controllers: PascalCase - UserController.ts - Services: camelCase - userService.ts - Routes: camelCase + Routes - userRoutes.ts - Repositories: PascalCase + Repository - UserRepository.ts --- ## Core Principles (7 Key Rules) ### 1. Routes Only Route, Controllers Control ### 2. All Controllers Extend BaseController ### 3. All Errors to Sentry ### 4. Use unifiedConfig, NEVER process.env ### 5. Validate All Input with Zod ### 6.

--- ## Service Comparison ### Email Service (Mature Pattern \u2705) **Strengths:** - Comprehensive BaseController with Sentry integration - Clean route delegation (no business logic in routes) - Consistent dependency injection pattern - Good middleware organization - Type-safe throughout - Excellent error handling **Example Structure:** **Use as template** for new services! ### Form Service (Transitioning \u26a0\ufe0f) **Strengths:** - Excellent workflow architecture (event sourcing) - Good Sentry integration - Innovative audit middleware (AsyncLocalStorage) - Comprehensive permission system **Weaknesses:** - Some routes have 200+ lines of business logic - Inconsistent controller naming - Direct process.env usage (60+ occurrences) - Minimal repository pattern usage **Example:** **Learn from:** workflow/, middleware/auditMiddleware.ts **Avoid:** responseRoutes.ts, direct process.env --- ## Directory Structure Rationale ### Controllers Directory **Purpose:** Handle HTTP request/response concerns **Contents:** - BaseController.ts - Base class with common methods - {Feature}Controller.ts - Feature-specific controllers **Naming:** PascalCase + Controller **Responsibilities:** - Parse request parameters - Validate input (Zod) - Call appropriate service methods - Format responses - Handle errors (via BaseController) - Set HTTP status codes ### Services Directory **Purpose:** Business logic and orchestration **Contents:** - {feature}Service.ts - Feature business logic **Naming:** camelCase + Service (or PascalCase + Service) **Responsibilities:** - Implement business rules - Orchestrate multiple repositories - Transaction management - Business validations - No HTTP knowledge (Request/Response types) ### Repositories Directory **Purpose:** Data access abstraction **Contents:** - {Entity}Repository.ts - Database operations for entity **Naming:** PascalCase + Repository **Responsibilities:** - Prisma query operations - Query optimization - Database error handling - Caching layer - Hide Prisma implementation details **Current Gap:** Only 1 repository exists (WorkflowRepository) ### Routes Directory **Purpose:** Route registration ONLY **Contents:** - {feature}Routes.ts - Express router for feature **Naming:** camelCase + Routes **Responsibilities:** - Register routes with Express - Apply middleware - Delegate to controllers - **NO business logic!** ### Middleware Directory **Purpose:** Cross-cutting concerns **Contents:** - Authentication middleware - Audit middleware - Error boundaries - Validation middleware - Custom middleware **Naming:** camelCase **Types:** - Request processing (before handler) - Response processing (after handler) - Error handling (error boundary) ### Config Directory **Purpose:** Configuration management **Contents:** - unifiedConfig.ts - Type-safe configuration - Environment-specific configs **Pattern:** Single source of truth ### Types Directory **Purpose:** TypeScript type definitions **Contents:** - {feature}.types.ts - Feature-specific types - DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) - Request/Response types - Domain models --- ## Module Organization ### Feature-Based Organization For large features, use subdirectories: **When to use:** - Feature has 5+ files - Clear sub-domains exist - Logical grouping improves clarity ### Flat Organization For simple features: **When to use:** - Simple features (< 5 files) - No clear sub-domains - Flat structure is clearer --- ## Separation of Concerns ### What Goes Where **Routes Layer:** - \u2705 Route definitions - \u2705 Middleware registration - \u2705 Controller delegation - \u274c Business logic - \u274c Database operations - \u274c Validation logic (should be in validator or controller) **Controllers Layer:** - \u2705 Request parsing (params, body, query) - \u2705 Input validation (Zod) - \u2705 Service calls - \u2705 Response formatting - \u2705 Error handling - \u274c Business logic - \u274c Database operations **Services Layer:** - \u2705 Business logic - \u2705 Business rules enforcement - \u2705 Orchestration (multiple repos) - \u2705 Transaction management - \u274c HTTP concerns (Request/Response) - \u274c Direct Prisma calls (use repositories) **Repositories Layer:** - \u2705 Prisma operations - \u2705 Query construction - \u2705 Database error handling - \u2705 Caching - \u274c Business logic - \u274c HTTP concerns ### Example: User Creation **Route:** **Controller:** **Service:** **Repository:** **Notice:** Each layer has clear, distinct responsibilities!

Explores user intent, requirements and design before implementation.\" --- # Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs ## Overview Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue. Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far. ## The Process **Understanding the idea:** - Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits) - Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea - Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too - Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions - Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria **Exploring approaches:** - Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs - Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning - Lead with your recommended option and explain why **Presenting the design:** - Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design - Break it into sections of 200-300 words - Ask after each section whether it looks right so far - Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing - Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense ## After the Design **Documentation:** - Write the validated design to docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md - Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available - Commit the design document to git **Implementation (if continuing):** - Ask: \"Ready to set up for implementation?\" - Use superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create isolated workspace - Use superpowers:writing-plans to create detailed implementation plan ## Key Principles - **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions - **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible - **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs - **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling - **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each - **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "brainstorming", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\brainstorming\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

It provides comprehensive guidance for using Burp Suite's core features for web application security testing. metadata: author: zebbern version: \"1.1\" --- # Burp Suite Web Application Testing ## Purpose Execute comprehensive web application security testing using Burp Suite's integrated toolset, including HTTP traffic interception and modification, request analysis and replay, automated vulnerability scanning, and manual testing workflows. This skill enables systematic discovery and exploitation of web application vulnerabilities through proxy-based testing methodology. ## Inputs / Prerequisites ### Required Tools - Burp Suite Community or Professional Edition installed - Burp's embedded browser or configured external browser - Target web application URL - Valid credentials for authenticated testing (if applicable) ### Environment Setup - Burp Suite launched with temporary or named project - Proxy listener active on 127.0.0.1:8080 (default) - Browser configured to use Burp proxy (or use Burp's browser) - CA certificate installed for HTTPS interception ### Editions Comparison | Feature | Community | Professional | |---------|-----------|--------------| | Proxy | \u2713 | \u2713 | | Repeater | \u2713 | \u2713 | | Intruder | Limited | Full | | Scanner | \u2717 | \u2713 | | Extensions | \u2713 | \u2713 | ## Outputs / Deliverables ### Primary Outputs - Intercepted and modified HTTP requests/responses - Vulnerability scan reports with remediation advice - HTTP history and site map documentation - Proof-of-concept exploits for identified vulnerabilities ## Core Workflow ### Phase 1: Intercepting HTTP Traffic #### Launch Burp's Browser Navigate to integrated browser for seamless proxy integration: 1. Open Burp Suite and create/open project 2. Go to **Proxy > Intercept** tab 3. Click **Open Browser** to launch preconfigured browser 4. Position windows to view both Burp and browser simultaneously #### Configure Interception Control which requests are captured: #### Intercept and Forward Requests Process intercepted traffic: 1. Set intercept toggle to **Intercept on** 2. Navigate to target URL in browser 3. Observe request held in Proxy > Intercept tab 4. Review request contents (headers, parameters, body) 5. Click **Forward** to send request to server 6. Continue forwarding subsequent requests until page loads #### View HTTP History Access complete traffic log: 1. Go to **Proxy > HTTP history** tab 2. Click any entry to view full request/response 3. Sort by clicking column headers (# for chronological order) 4. Use filters to focus on relevant traffic ### Phase 2: Modifying Requests #### Intercept and Modify Change request parameters before forwarding: 1. Enable interception: **Intercept on** 2. Trigger target request in browser 3. Locate parameter to modify in intercepted request 4. Edit value directly in request editor 5. Click **Forward** to send modified request #### Common Modification Targets | Target | Example | Purpose | |--------|---------|---------| | Price parameters | price=1 | Test business logic | | User IDs | userId=admin | Test access control | | Quantity values | qty=-1 | Test input validation | | Hidden fields | isAdmin=true | Test privilege escalation | #### Example: Price Manipulation Result: Item added to cart at modified price. ### Phase 3: Setting Target Scope #### Define Scope Focus testing on specific target: 1. Go to **Target > Site map** 2. Right-click target host in left panel 3. Select **Add to scope** 4. When prompted, click **Yes** to exclude out-of-scope traffic #### Filter by Scope Remove noise from HTTP history: 1. Click display filter above HTTP history 2. Select **Show only in-scope items** 3. History now shows only target site traffic #### Scope Benefits - Reduces clutter from third-party requests - Prevents accidental testing of out-of-scope sites - Improves scanning efficiency - Creates cleaner reports ### Phase 4: Using Burp Repeater #### Send Request to Repeater Prepare request for manual testing: 1. Identify interesting request in HTTP history 2. Right-click request and select **Send to Repeater** 3. Go to **Repeater** tab to access request #### Modify and Resend Test different inputs efficiently: #### Repeater Testing Workflow #### Analyze Responses Look for indicators of vulnerabilities: - Error messages revealing stack traces - Framework/version information disclosure - Different response lengths indicating logic flaws - Timing differences suggesting blind injection - Unexpected data in responses ### Phase 5: Running Automated Scans #### Launch New Scan Initiate vulnerability scanning (Professional only): 1. Go to **Dashboard** tab 2. Click **New scan** 3. Enter target URL in **URLs to scan** field 4. Configure scan settings #### Scan Configuration Options | Mode | Description | Duration | |------|-------------|----------| | Lightweight | High-level overview | ~15 minutes | | Fast | Quick vulnerability check | ~30 minutes | | Balanced | Standard comprehensive scan | ~1-2 hours | | Deep | Thorough testing | Several hours | #### Monitor Scan Progress Track scanning activity: 1. View task status in **Dashboard** 2. Watch **Target > Site map** update in real-time 3. Check **Issues** tab for discovered vulnerabilities #### Review Identified Issues Analyze scan findings: 1. Select scan task in Dashboard 2. Go to **Issues** tab 3. Click issue to view: - **Advisory**: Description and remediation - **Request**: Triggering HTTP request - **Response**: Server response showing vulnerability ### Phase 6: Intruder Attacks #### Configure Intruder Set up automated attack: 1. Send request to Intruder (right-click > Send to Intruder) 2. Go to **Intruder** tab 3. Define payload positions using \u00a7 markers 4. Select attack type #### Attack Types | Type | Description | Use Case | |------|-------------|----------| | Sniper | Single position, iterate payloads | Fuzzing one parameter | | Battering ram | Same payload all positions | Credential testing | | Pitchfork | Parallel payload iteration | Username:password pairs | | Cluster bomb | All payload combinations | Full brute force | #### Configure Payloads #### Analyze Results Review attack output: - Sort by response length to find anomalies - Filter by status code for successful attempts - Use grep to search for specific strings - Export results for documentation ## Quick Reference ### Keyboard Shortcuts | Action | Windows/Linux | macOS | |--------|---------------|-------| | Forward request | Ctrl+F | Cmd+F | | Drop request | Ctrl+D | Cmd+D | | Send to Repeater | Ctrl+R | Cmd+R | | Send to Intruder | Ctrl+I | Cmd+I | | Toggle intercept | Ctrl+T | Cmd+T | ### Common Testing Payloads ### Request Modification Tips - Right-click for context menu options - Use decoder for encoding/decoding - Compare requests using Comparer tool - Save interesting requests to project ## Constraints and Guardrails ### Operational Boundaries - Test only authorized applications - Configure scope to prevent accidental out-of-scope testing - Rate-limit scans to avoid denial of service - Document all findings and actions ### Technical Limitations - Community Edition lacks automated scanner - Some sites may block proxy traffic - HSTS/certificate pinning may require additional configuration - Heavy scanning may trigger WAF blocks ### Best Practices - Always set target scope before extensive testing - Use Burp's browser for reliable interception - Save project regularly to preserve work - Review scan results manually for false positives ## Examples ### Example 1: Business Logic Testing **Scenario**: E-commerce price manipulation 1. Add item to cart normally, intercept request 2. Identify price=9999 parameter in POST body 3. Modify to price=1 4. Forward request 5. Complete checkout at manipulated price **Finding**: Server trusts client-provided price values. ### Example 2: Authentication Bypass **Scenario**: Testing login form 1. Submit valid credentials, capture request in Repeater 2. Send to Repeater for testing 3. Try: username=admin' OR '1'='1'-- 4. Observe successful login response **Finding**: SQL injection in authentication. ### Example 3: Information Disclosure **Scenario**: Error-based information gathering 1. Navigate to product page, observe productId parameter 2. Send request to Repeater 3. Change productId=1 to productId=test 4. Observe verbose error revealing framework version **Finding**: Apache Struts 2.5.12 disclosed in stack trace. ## Troubleshooting ### Browser Not Connecting Through Proxy - Verify proxy listener is active (Proxy > Options) - Check browser proxy settings point to 127.0.0.1:8080 - Ensure no firewall blocking local connections - Use Burp's embedded browser for reliable setup ### HTTPS Interception Failing - Install Burp CA certificate in browser/system - Navigate to http://burp to download certificate - Add certificate to trusted roots - Restart browser after installation ### Slow Performance - Limit scope to reduce processing - Disable unnecessary extensions - Increase Java heap size in startup options - Close unused Burp tabs and features ### Requests Not Being Intercepted - Verify \"Intercept on\" is enabled - Check intercept rules aren't filtering target - Ensure browser is using Burp proxy - Verify target isn't using unsupported protocol", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "burp-suite-testing", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\burp-suite-testing\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}
{"id": "skill_canvasdesign_skill", "text": "--- name: canvas-design description: Create beautiful visual art in .png and .pdf documents using design philosophy. You should use this skill when the user asks to create a poster, piece of art, design, or other static piece. Create original visual designs, never copying existing artists' work to avoid copyright violations. license: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt --- These are instructions for creating design philosophies - aesthetic movements that are then EXPRESSED VISUALLY. Output only .md files, .pdf files, and .png files. Complete this in two steps: 1. Design Philosophy Creation (.md file) 2. Express by creating it on a canvas (.pdf file or .png file) First, undertake this task: ## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY CREATION To begin, create a VISUAL PHILOSOPHY (not layouts or templates) that will be interpreted through: - Form, space, color, composition - Images, graphics, shapes, patterns - Minimal text as visual accent ### THE CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING - What is received: Some subtle input or instructions by the user that should be taken into account, but used as a foundation; it should not constrain creative freedom. - What is created: A design philosophy/aesthetic movement. - What happens next: Then, the same version receives the philosophy and EXPRESSES IT VISUALLY - creating artifacts that are 90% visual design, 10% essential text. Consider this approach: - Write a manifesto for an art movement - The next phase involves making the artwork The philosophy must emphasize: Visual expression. Spatial communication. Artistic interpretation. Minimal words. ### HOW TO GENERATE A VISUAL PHILOSOPHY **Name the movement** (1-2 words): \"Brutalist Joy\" / \"Chromatic Silence\" / \"Metabolist Dreams\" **Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs - concise but complete): To capture the VISUAL essence, express how the philosophy manifests through: - Space and form - Color and material - Scale and rhythm - Composition and balance - Visual hierarchy **CRITICAL GUIDELINES:** - **Avoid redundancy**: Each design aspect should be mentioned once. Avoid repeating points about color theory, spatial relationships, or typographic principles unless adding new depth. - **Emphasize craftsmanship REPEATEDLY**: The philosophy MUST stress multiple times that the final work should appear as though it took countless hours to create, was labored over with care, and comes from someone at the absolute top of their field. This framing is essential - repeat phrases like \"meticulously crafted,\" \"the product of deep expertise,\" \"painstaking attention,\" \"master-level execution.\" - **Leave creative space**: Remain specific about the aesthetic direction, but concise enough that the next Claude has room to make interpretive choices also at a extremely high level of craftmanship. The philosophy must guide the next version to express ideas VISUALLY, not through text. Information lives in design, not paragraphs. ### PHILOSOPHY EXAMPLES **\"Concrete Poetry\"** Philosophy: Communication through monumental form and bold geometry. Visual expression: Massive color blocks, sculptural typography (huge single words, tiny labels), Brutalist spatial divisions, Polish poster energy meets Le Corbusier. Ideas expressed through visual weight and spatial tension, not explanation. Text as rare, powerful gesture - never paragraphs, only essential words integrated into the visual architecture. Every element placed with the precision of a master craftsman. **\"Chromatic Language\"** Philosophy: Color as the primary information system. Visual expression: Geometric precision where color zones create meaning. Typography minimal - small sans-serif labels letting chromatic fields communicate. Think Josef Albers' interaction meets data visualization. Information encoded spatially and chromatically. Words only to anchor what color already shows. The result of painstaking chromatic calibration. **\"Analog Meditation\"** Philosophy: Quiet visual contemplation through texture and breathing room. Visual expression: Paper grain, ink bleeds, vast negative space. Photography and illustration dominate. Typography whispered (small, restrained, serving the visual). Japanese photobook aesthetic. Images breathe across pages. Text appears sparingly - short phrases, never explanatory blocks. Each composition balanced with the care of a meditation practice. **\"Organic Systems\"** Philosophy: Natural clustering and modular growth patterns. Visual expression: Rounded forms, organic arrangements, color from nature through architecture. Information shown through visual diagrams, spatial relationships, iconography. Text only for key labels floating in space. The composition tells the story through expert spatial orchestration. **\"Geometric Silence\"** Philosophy: Pure order and restraint. Visual expression: Grid-based precision, bold photography or stark graphics, dramatic negative space. Typography precise but minimal - small essential text, large quiet zones. Swiss formalism meets Brutalist material honesty. Structure communicates, not words. Every alignment the work of countless refinements. *These are condensed examples. The actual design philosophy should be 4-6 substantial paragraphs.* ### ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES - **VISUAL PHILOSOPHY**: Create an aesthetic worldview to be expressed through design - **MINIMAL TEXT**: Always emphasize that text is sparse, essential-only, integrated as visual element - never lengthy - **SPATIAL EXPRESSION**: Ideas communicate through space, form, color, composition - not paragraphs - **ARTISTIC FREEDOM**: The next Claude interprets the philosophy visually - provide creative room - **PURE DESIGN**: This is about making ART OBJECTS, not documents with decoration - **EXPERT CRAFTSMANSHIP**: Repeatedly emphasize the final work must look meticulously crafted, labored over with care, the product of countless hours by someone at the top of their field **The design philosophy should be 4-6 paragraphs long.** Fill it with poetic design philosophy that brings together the core vision. Avoid repeating the same points. Keep the design philosophy generic without mentioning the intention of the art, as if it can be used wherever. Output the design philosophy as a .md file. --- ## DEDUCING THE SUBTLE REFERENCE **CRITICAL STEP**: Before creating the canvas, identify the subtle conceptual thread from the original request. **THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLE**: The topic is a **subtle, niche reference embedded within the art itself** - not always literal, always sophisticated. Someone familiar with the subject should feel it intuitively, while others simply experience a masterful abstract composition. The design philosophy provides the aesthetic language. The deduced topic provides the soul - the quiet conceptual DNA woven invisibly into form, color, and composition. This is **VERY IMPORTANT**: The reference must be refined so it enhances the work's depth without announcing itself. Think like a jazz musician quoting another song - only those who know will catch it, but everyone appreciates the music. --- ## CANVAS CREATION With both the philosophy and the conceptual framework established, express it on a canvas. Take a moment to gather thoughts and clear the mind. Use the design philosophy created and the instructions below to craft a masterpiece, embodying all aspects of the philosophy with expert craftsmanship. **IMPORTANT**: For any type of content, even if the user requests something for a movie/game/book, the approach should still be sophisticated. Never lose sight of the idea that this should be art, not something that's cartoony or amateur. To create museum or magazine quality work, use the design philosophy as the foundation. Create one single page, highly visual, design-forward PDF or PNG output (unless asked for more pages). Generally use repeating patterns and perfect shapes. Treat the abstract philosophical design as if it were a scientific bible, borrowing the visual language of systematic observation\u2014dense accumulation of marks, repeated elements, or layered patterns that build meaning through patient repetition and reward sustained viewing. Add sparse, clinical typography and systematic reference markers that suggest this could be a diagram from an imaginary discipline, treating the invisible subject with the same reverence typically reserved for documenting observable phenomena. Anchor the piece with simple phrase(s) or details positioned subtly, using a limited color palette that feels intentional and cohesive. Embrace the paradox of using analytical visual language to express ideas about human experience: the result should feel like an artifact that proves something ephemeral can be studied, mapped, and understood through careful attention. This is true art. **Text as a contextual element**: Text is always minimal and visual-first, but let context guide whether that means whisper-quiet labels or bold typographic gestures. A punk venue poster might have larger, more aggressive type than a minimalist ceramics studio identity. Most of the time, font should be thin. All use of fonts must be design-forward and prioritize visual communication. Regardless of text scale, nothing falls off the page and nothing overlaps. Every element must be contained within the canvas boundaries with proper margins. Check carefully that all text, graphics, and visual elements have breathing room and clear separation. This is non-negotiable for professional execution. **IMPORTANT: Use different fonts if writing text. Search the ./canvas-fonts directory. Regardless of approach, sophistication is non-negotiable.** Download and use whatever fonts are needed to make this a reality. Get creative by making the typography actually part of the art itself -- if the art is abstract, bring the font onto the canvas, not typeset digitally. To push boundaries, follow design instinct/intuition while using the philosophy as a guiding principle. Embrace ultimate design freedom and choice. Push aesthetics and design to the frontier. **CRITICAL**: To achieve human-crafted quality (not AI-generated), create work that looks like it took countless hours. Make it appear as though someone at the absolute top of their field labored over every detail with painstaking care. Ensure the composition, spacing, color choices, typography - everything screams expert-level craftsmanship. Double-check that nothing overlaps, formatting is flawless, every detail perfect. Create something that could be shown to people to prove expertise and rank as undeniably impressive. Output the final result as a single, downloadable .pdf or .png file, alongside the design philosophy used as a .md file. --- ## FINAL STEP **IMPORTANT**: The user ALREADY said \"It isn't perfect enough. It must be pristine, a masterpiece if craftsmanship, as if it were about to be displayed in a museum.\" **CRITICAL**: To refine the work, avoid adding more graphics; instead refine what has been created and make it extremely crisp, respecting the design philosophy and the principles of minimalism entirely. Rather than adding a fun filter or refactoring a font, consider how to make the existing composition more cohesive with the art. If the instinct is to call a new function or draw a new shape, STOP and instead ask: \"How can I make what's already here more of a piece of art?\" Take a second pass. Go back to the code and refine/polish further to make this a philosophically designed masterpiece. ## MULTI-PAGE OPTION To create additional pages when requested, create more creative pages along the same lines as the design philosophy but distinctly different as well. Bundle those pages in the same .pdf or many .pngs. Treat the first page as just a single page in a whole coffee table book waiting to be filled. Make the next pages unique twists and memories of the original. Have them almost tell a story in a very tasteful way. Exercise full creative freedom.", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "canvas-design", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\canvas-design\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

This skill synthesizes best practices, configuration templates, and advanced usage patterns. ## Configuration (CLAUDE.md) When starting a new project, create a CLAUDE.md file in the root directory to guide the agent. ### Template (General) ## Advanced Features ### Thinking Keywords Use these keywords in your prompts to trigger deeper reasoning from the agent: - \"Think step-by-step\" - \"Analyze the root cause\" - \"Plan before executing\" - \"Verify your assumptions\" ### Debugging If the agent is stuck or behaving unexpectedly: 1. **Clear Context**: Start a new session or ask the agent to \"forget previous instructions\" if confused. 2. **Explicit Instructions**: Be extremely specific about paths, filenames, and desired outcomes. 3. **Logs**: Ask the agent to \"check the logs\" or \"run the command with verbose output\". ## Best Practices 1. **Small Contexts**: Don't dump the entire codebase into the context. Use grep or find to locate relevant files first. 2. **Iterative Development**: Ask for small changes, verify, then proceed. 3. **Feedback Loop**: If the agent makes a mistake, correct it immediately and ask it to \"add a lesson\" to its memory (if supported) or CLAUDE.md. ## Reference Based on [Claude Code Guide by zebbern](https://github.com/zebbern/claude-code-guide).", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "claude-code-guide", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\claude-code-guide\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}
{"id": "skill_clauded3jsskill_skill", "text": "--- name: d3-viz description: Creating interactive data visualisations using d3.js. This skill should be used when creating custom charts, graphs, network diagrams, geographic visualisations, or any complex SVG-based data visualisation that requires fine-grained control over visual elements, transitions, or interactions. Use this for bespoke visualisations beyond standard charting libraries, whether in React, Vue, Svelte, vanilla JavaScript, or any other environment. --- # D3.js Visualisation ## Overview This skill provides guidance for creating sophisticated, interactive data visualisations using d3.js. D3.js (Data-Driven Documents) excels at binding data to DOM elements and applying data-driven transformations to create custom, publication-quality visualisations with precise control over every visual element. The techniques work across any JavaScript environment, including vanilla JavaScript, React, Vue, Svelte, and other frameworks. ## When to use d3.js **Use d3.js for:** - Custom visualisations requiring unique visual encodings or layouts - Interactive explorations with complex pan, zoom, or brush behaviours - Network/graph visualisations (force-directed layouts, tree diagrams, hierarchies, chord diagrams) - Geographic visualisations with custom projections - Visualisations requiring smooth, choreographed transitions - Publication-quality graphics with fine-grained styling control - Novel chart types not available in standard libraries **Consider alternatives for:** - 3D visualisations - use Three.js instead ## Core workflow ### 1. Set up d3.js Import d3 at the top of your script: Or use the CDN version (7.x): All modules (scales, axes, shapes, transitions, etc.) are accessible through the d3 namespace. ### 2. Choose the integration pattern **Pattern A: Direct DOM manipulation (recommended for most cases)** Use d3 to select DOM elements and manipulate them imperatively. This works in any JavaScript environment: **Pattern B: Declarative rendering (for frameworks with templating)** Use d3 for data calculations (scales, layouts) but render elements via your framework: Use Pattern A for complex visualisations with transitions, interactions, or when leveraging d3's full capabilities. Use Pattern B for simpler visualisations or when your framework prefers declarative rendering. ### 3. Structure the visualisation code Follow this standard structure in your drawing function: ### 4. Implement responsive sizing Make visualisations responsive to container size: Or use ResizeObserver for more direct container monitoring: ## Common visualisation patterns ### Bar chart ### Line chart ### Scatter plot ### Chord diagram A chord diagram shows relationships between entities in a circular layout, with ribbons representing flows between them: ### Heatmap A heatmap uses colour to encode values in a two-dimensional grid, useful for showing patterns across categories: ### Pie chart ### Force-directed network ## Adding interactivity ### Tooltips ### Zoom and pan ### Click interactions ## Transitions and animations Add smooth transitions to visual changes: ## Scales reference ### Quantitative scales ### Ordinal scales ### Sequential scales ## Best practices ### Data preparation Always validate and prepare data before visualisation: ### Performance optimisation For large datasets (>1000 elements): ### Accessibility Make visualisations accessible: ### Styling Use consistent, professional styling: ## Common issues and solutions **Issue**: Axes not appearing - Ensure scales have valid domains (check for NaN values) - Verify axis is appended to correct group - Check transform translations are correct **Issue**: Transitions not working - Call .transition() before attribute changes - Ensure elements have unique keys for proper data binding - Check that useEffect dependencies include all changing data **Issue**: Responsive sizing not working - Use ResizeObserver or window resize listener - Update dimensions in state to trigger re-render - Ensure SVG has width/height attributes or viewBox **Issue**: Performance problems - Limit number of DOM elements (consider canvas for >1000 items) - Debounce resize handlers - Use .join() instead of separate enter/update/exit selections - Avoid unnecessary re-renders by checking dependencies ## Resources ### references/ Contains detailed reference materials: - d3-patterns.md - Comprehensive collection of visualisation patterns and code examples - scale-reference.md - Complete guide to d3 scales with examples - colour-schemes.md - D3 colour schemes and palette recommendations ### assets/ Contains boilerplate templates: - chart-template.js - Starter template for basic chart - interactive-template.js - Template with tooltips, zoom, and interactions - sample-data.json - Example datasets for testing These templates work with vanilla JavaScript, React, Vue, Svelte, or any other JavaScript environment.

{"id": "skill_competitoralternatives_skill", "text": "--- name: competitor-alternatives description: \"When the user wants to create competitor comparison or alternative pages for SEO and sales enablement. Also use when the user mentions 'alternative page,' 'vs page,' 'competitor comparison,' 'comparison page,' '[Product] vs [Product],' '[Product] alternative,' or 'competitive landing pages.' Covers four formats: singular alternative, plural alternatives, you vs competitor, and competitor vs competitor. Emphasizes deep research, modular content architecture, and varied section types beyond feature tables.\" --- # Competitor & Alternative Pages You are an expert in creating competitor comparison and alternative pages. Your goal is to build pages that rank for competitive search terms, provide genuine value to evaluators, and position your product effectively. ## Initial Assessment Before creating competitor pages, understand: 1. **Your Product** - Core value proposition - Key differentiators - Ideal customer profile - Pricing model - Strengths and honest weaknesses 2. **Competitive Landscape** - Direct competitors - Indirect/adjacent competitors - Market positioning of each - Search volume for competitor terms 3. **Goals** - SEO traffic capture - Sales enablement - Conversion from competitor users - Brand positioning --- ## Core Principles ### 1. Honesty Builds Trust - Acknowledge competitor strengths - Be accurate about your limitations - Don't misrepresent competitor features - Readers are comparing\u2014they'll verify claims ### 2. Depth Over Surface - Go beyond feature checklists - Explain *why* differences matter - Include use cases and scenarios - Show, don't just tell ### 3. Help Them Decide - Different tools fit different needs - Be clear about who you're best for - Be clear about who competitor is best for - Reduce evaluation friction ### 4. Modular Content Architecture - Competitor data should be centralized - Updates propagate to all pages - Avoid duplicating research - Single source of truth per competitor --- ## Page Formats ### Format 1: [Competitor] Alternative (Singular) **Search intent**: User is actively looking to switch from a specific competitor **URL pattern**: /alternatives/[competitor] or /[competitor]-alternative **Target keywords**: - \"[Competitor] alternative\" - \"alternative to [Competitor]\" - \"switch from [Competitor]\" - \"[Competitor] replacement\" **Page structure**: 1. Why people look for alternatives (validate their pain) 2. Summary: You as the alternative (quick positioning) 3. Detailed comparison (features, service, pricing) 4. Who should switch (and who shouldn't) 5. Migration path 6. Social proof from switchers 7. CTA **Tone**: Empathetic to their frustration, helpful guide --- ### Format 2: [Competitor] Alternatives (Plural) **Search intent**: User is researching options, earlier in journey **URL pattern**: /alternatives/[competitor]-alternatives or /best-[competitor]-alternatives **Target keywords**: - \"[Competitor] alternatives\" - \"best [Competitor] alternatives\" - \"tools like [Competitor]\" - \"[Competitor] competitors\" **Page structure**: 1. Why people look for alternatives (common pain points) 2. What to look for in an alternative (criteria framework) 3. List of alternatives (you first, but include real options) 4. Comparison table (summary) 5. Detailed breakdown of each alternative 6. Recommendation by use case 7. CTA **Tone**: Objective guide, you're one option among several (but positioned well) **Important**: Include 4-7 real alternatives. Being genuinely helpful builds trust and ranks better. --- ### Format 3: You vs [Competitor] **Search intent**: User is directly comparing you to a specific competitor **URL pattern**: /vs/[competitor] or /compare/[you]-vs-[competitor] **Target keywords**: - \"[You] vs [Competitor]\" - \"[Competitor] vs [You]\" - \"[You] compared to [Competitor]\" - \"[You] or [Competitor]\" **Page structure**: 1. TL;DR summary (key differences in 2-3 sentences) 2. At-a-glance comparison table 3. Detailed comparison by category: - Features - Pricing - Service & support - Ease of use - Integrations 4. Who [You] is best for 5. Who [Competitor] is best for (be honest) 6. What customers say (testimonials from switchers) 7. Migration support 8. CTA **Tone**: Confident but fair, acknowledge where competitor excels --- ### Format 4: [Competitor A] vs [Competitor B] **Search intent**: User comparing two competitors (not you directly) **URL pattern**: /compare/[competitor-a]-vs-[competitor-b] **Target keywords**: - \"[Competitor A] vs [Competitor B]\" - \"[Competitor A] or [Competitor B]\" - \"[Competitor A] compared to [Competitor B]\" **Page structure**: 1. Overview of both products 2. Comparison by category 3. Who each is best for 4. The third option (introduce yourself) 5. Comparison table (all three) 6. CTA **Tone**: Objective analyst, earn trust through fairness, then introduce yourself **Why this works**: Captures search traffic for competitor terms, positions you as knowledgeable, introduces you to qualified audience. --- ## Index Pages Each format needs an index page that lists all pages of that type. These hub pages serve as navigation aids, SEO consolidators, and entry points for visitors exploring multiple comparisons. ### Alternatives Index **URL**: /alternatives or /alternatives/index **Purpose**: Lists all \"[Competitor] Alternative\" pages **Page structure**: 1. Headline: \"[Your Product] as an Alternative\" 2. Brief intro on why people switch to you 3. List of all alternative pages with: - Competitor name/logo - One-line summary of key differentiator vs. that competitor - Link to full comparison 4. Common reasons people switch (aggregated) 5. CTA **Example**: --- ### Alternatives (Plural) Index **URL**: /alternatives/compare or /best-alternatives **Purpose**: Lists all \"[Competitor] Alternatives\" roundup pages **Page structure**: 1. Headline: \"Software Alternatives & Comparisons\" 2. Brief intro on your comparison methodology 3. List of all alternatives roundup pages with: - Competitor name - Number of alternatives covered - Link to roundup 4. CTA **Example**: --- ### Vs Comparisons Index **URL**: /vs or /compare **Purpose**: Lists all \"You vs [Competitor]\" and \"[A] vs [B]\" pages **Page structure**: 1. Headline: \"Compare [Your Product]\" 2. Section: \"[Your Product] vs Competitors\" \u2014 list of direct comparisons 3. Section: \"Head-to-Head Comparisons\" \u2014 list of [A] vs [B] pages 4. Brief methodology note 5. CTA **Example**: --- ### Index Page Best Practices **Keep them updated**: When you add a new comparison page, add it to the relevant index. **Internal linking**: - Link from index \u2192 individual pages - Link from individual pages \u2192 back to index - Cross-link between related comparisons **SEO value**: - Index pages can rank for broad terms like \"project management tool comparisons\" - Pass link equity to individual comparison pages - Help search engines discover all comparison content **Sorting options**: - By popularity (search volume) - Alphabetically - By category/use case - By date added (show freshness) **Include on index pages**: - Last updated date for credibility - Number of pages/comparisons available - Quick filters if you have many comparisons --- ## Content Architecture ### Centralized Competitor Data Create a single source of truth for each competitor: **Per competitor, document**: ### Your Product Data Same structure for yourself\u2014be honest: ### Page Generation Each page pulls from centralized data: - **[Competitor] Alternative page**: Pulls competitor data + your data - **[Competitor] Alternatives page**: Pulls competitor data + your data + other alternatives - **You vs [Competitor] page**: Pulls your data + competitor data - **[A] vs [B] page**: Pulls both competitor data + your data **Benefits**: - Update competitor pricing once, updates everywhere - Add new feature comparison once, appears on all pages - Consistent accuracy across pages - Easier to maintain at scale --- ## Section Templates ### TL;DR Summary Start every page with a quick summary for scanners: ### Paragraph Comparison (Not Just Tables) For each major dimension, write a paragraph: ### Feature Comparison Section Go beyond checkmarks: ### Pricing Comparison Section ### Service & Support Comparison ### Who It's For Section ### Migration Section ### Social Proof Section Focus on switchers: --- ## Comparison Table Best Practices ### Beyond Checkmarks Instead of: | Feature | You | Competitor | |---------|-----|-----------| | Feature A | \u2713 | \u2713 | | Feature B | \u2713 | \u2717 | Do this: | Feature | You | Competitor | |---------|-----|-----------| | Feature A | Full support with [detail] | Basic support, [limitation] | | Feature B | [Specific capability] | Not available | ### Organize by Category Group features into meaningful categories: - Core functionality - Collaboration - Integrations - Security & compliance - Support & service ### Include Ratings Where Useful | Category | You | Competitor | Notes | |----------|-----|-----------|-------| | Ease of use | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | [Brief note] | | Feature depth | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | [Brief note] | --- ## Research Process ### Deep Competitor Research For each competitor, gather: 1. **Product research** - Sign up for free trial - Use the product yourself - Document features, UX, limitations - Take screenshots 2. **Pricing research** - Current pricing (check regularly) - What's included at each tier - Hidden costs, add-ons - Contract terms 3. **Review mining** - G2, Capterra, TrustRadius reviews - Common praise themes - Common complaint themes - Ratings by category 4. **Customer feedback** - Talk to customers who switched - Talk to prospects who chose competitor - Document real quotes 5. **Content research** - Their positioning and messaging - Their comparison pages (how do they compare to you?) - Their documentation quality - Their changelog (recent development) ### Ongoing Updates Competitor pages need maintenance: - **Quarterly**: Verify pricing, check for major feature changes - **When notified**: Customer mentions competitor change - **Annually**: Full refresh of all competitor data --- ## SEO Considerations ### Keyword Targeting | Format | Primary Keywords | Secondary Keywords | |--------|-----------------|-------------------| | Alternative (singular) | [Competitor] alternative | alternative to [Competitor], switch from [Competitor], [Competitor] replacement | | Alternatives (plural) | [Competitor] alternatives | best [Competitor] alternatives, tools like [Competitor], [Competitor] competitors | | You vs Competitor | [You] vs [Competitor] | [Competitor] vs [You], [You] compared to [Competitor] | | Competitor vs Competitor | [A] vs [B] | [B] vs [A], [A] or [B], [A] compared to [B] | ### Internal Linking - Link between related competitor pages - Link from feature pages to relevant comparisons - Link from blog posts mentioning competitors - Hub page linking to all competitor content ### Schema Markup Consider FAQ schema for common questions: --- ## Output Format ### Competitor Data File ### Page Content For each page: - URL and meta tags - Full page copy organized by section - Comparison tables - CTAs ### Page Set Plan Recommended pages to create: 1. [List of alternative pages] 2. [List of vs pages] 3. Priority order based on search volume --- ## Questions to Ask If you need more context: 1. Who are your top 3-5 competitors? 2.

Use when: computer use, desktop automation agent, screen control AI, vision-based agent, GUI automation.\" source: vibeship-spawner-skills (Apache 2.0) --- # Computer Use Agents ## Patterns ### Perception-Reasoning-Action Loop The fundamental architecture of computer use agents: observe screen, reason about next action, execute action, repeat. This loop integrates vision models with action execution through an iterative pipeline. Key components: 1. PERCEPTION: Screenshot captures current screen state 2. REASONING: Vision-language model analyzes and plans 3. ACTION: Execute mouse/keyboard operations 4. FEEDBACK: Observe result, continue or correct Critical insight: Vision agents are completely still during \"thinking\" phase (1-5 seconds), creating a detectable pause pattern. **When to use**: ['Building any computer use agent from scratch', 'Integrating vision models with desktop control', 'Understanding agent behavior patterns'] ### Sandboxed Environment Pattern Computer use agents MUST run in isolated, sandboxed environments. Never give agents direct access to your main system - the security risks are too high. Use Docker containers with virtual desktops. Key isolation requirements: 1. NETWORK: Restrict to necessary endpoints only 2. FILESYSTEM: Read-only or scoped to temp directories 3. CREDENTIALS: No access to host credentials 4. SYSCALLS: Filter dangerous system calls 5. RESOURCES: Limit CPU, memory, time The goal is \"blast radius minimization\" - if the agent goes wrong, damage is contained to the sandbox. **When to use**: ['Deploying any computer use agent', 'Testing agent behavior safely', 'Running untrusted automation tasks'] ### Anthropic Computer Use Implementation Official implementation pattern using Claude's computer use capability. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was the first frontier model to offer computer use. Claude Opus 4.5 is now the \"best model in the world for computer use.\" Key capabilities: - screenshot: Capture current screen state - mouse: Click, move, drag operations - keyboard: Type text, press keys - bash: Run shell commands - text_editor: View and edit files Tool versions: - computer_20251124 (Opus 4.5): Adds zoom action for detailed inspection - computer_20250124 (All other models): Standard capabilities Critical limitation: \"Some UI elements (like dropdowns and scrollbars) might be tricky for Claude to manipulate\" - Anthropic docs **When to use**: ['Building production computer use agents', 'Need highest quality vision understanding', 'Full desktop control (not just browser)'] ## \u26a0\ufe0f Sharp Edges | Issue | Severity | Solution | |-------|----------|----------| | Issue | critical | ## Defense in depth - no single solution works | | Issue | medium | ## Add human-like variance to actions | | Issue | high | ## Use keyboard alternatives when possible | | Issue | medium | ## Accept the tradeoff | | Issue | high | ## Implement context management | | Issue | high | ## Monitor and limit costs | | Issue | critical | ## ALWAYS use sandboxing |", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "computer-use-agents", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\computer-use-agents\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

{"id": "skill_copyediting_skill", "text": "--- name: copy-editing description: \"When the user wants to edit, review, or improve existing marketing copy. Also use when the user mentions 'edit this copy,' 'review my copy,' 'copy feedback,' 'proofread,' 'polish this,' 'make this better,' or 'copy sweep.' This skill provides a systematic approach to editing marketing copy through multiple focused passes.\" --- # Copy Editing You are an expert copy editor specializing in marketing and conversion copy. Your goal is to systematically improve existing copy through focused editing passes while preserving the core message. ## Core Philosophy Good copy editing isn't about rewriting\u2014it's about enhancing. Each pass focuses on one dimension, catching issues that get missed when you try to fix everything at once. **Key principles:** - Don't change the core message; focus on enhancing it - Multiple focused passes beat one unfocused review - Each edit should have a clear reason - Preserve the author's voice while improving clarity --- ## The Seven Sweeps Framework Edit copy through seven sequential passes, each focusing on one dimension. After each sweep, loop back to check previous sweeps aren't compromised. ### Sweep 1: Clarity **Focus:** Can the reader understand what you're saying? **What to check:** - Confusing sentence structures - Unclear pronoun references - Jargon or insider language - Ambiguous statements - Missing context **Common clarity killers:** - Sentences trying to say too much - Abstract language instead of concrete - Assuming reader knowledge they don't have - Burying the point in qualifications **Process:** 1. Read through quickly, highlighting unclear parts 2. Don't correct yet\u2014just note problem areas 3. After marking issues, recommend specific edits 4. Verify edits maintain the original intent **After this sweep:** Confirm the \"Rule of One\" (one main idea per section) and \"You Rule\" (copy speaks to the reader) are intact. --- ### Sweep 2: Voice and Tone **Focus:** Is the copy consistent in how it sounds? **What to check:** - Shifts between formal and casual - Inconsistent brand personality - Mood changes that feel jarring - Word choices that don't match the brand **Common voice issues:** - Starting casual, becoming corporate - Mixing \"we\" and \"the company\" references - Humor in some places, serious in others (unintentionally) - Technical language appearing randomly **Process:** 1. Read aloud to hear inconsistencies 2. Mark where tone shifts unexpectedly 3. Recommend edits that smooth transitions 4. Ensure personality remains throughout **After this sweep:** Return to Clarity Sweep to ensure voice edits didn't introduce confusion. --- ### Sweep 3: So What **Focus:** Does every claim answer \"why should I care?\" **What to check:** - Features without benefits - Claims without consequences - Statements that don't connect to reader's life - Missing \"which means...\" bridges **The So What test:** For every statement, ask \"Okay, so what?\" If the copy doesn't answer that question with a deeper benefit, it needs work. \u274c \"Our platform uses AI-powered analytics\" *So what?* \u2705 \"Our AI-powered analytics surface insights you'd miss manually\u2014so you can make better decisions in half the time\" **Common So What failures:** - Feature lists without benefit connections - Impressive-sounding claims that don't land - Technical capabilities without outcomes - Company achievements that don't help the reader **Process:** 1. Read each claim and literally ask \"so what?\" 2. Highlight claims missing the answer 3. Add the benefit bridge or deeper meaning 4. Ensure benefits connect to real reader desires **After this sweep:** Return to Voice and Tone, then Clarity. --- ### Sweep 4: Prove It **Focus:** Is every claim supported with evidence? **What to check:** - Unsubstantiated claims - Missing social proof - Assertions without backup - \"Best\" or \"leading\" without evidence **Types of proof to look for:** - Testimonials with names and specifics - Case study references - Statistics and data - Third-party validation - Guarantees and risk reversals - Customer logos - Review scores **Common proof gaps:** - \"Trusted by thousands\" (which thousands?) - \"Industry-leading\" (according to whom?) - \"Customers love us\" (show them saying it) - Results claims without specifics **Process:** 1. Identify every claim that needs proof 2. Check if proof exists nearby 3. Flag unsupported assertions 4. Recommend adding proof or softening claims **After this sweep:** Return to So What, Voice and Tone, then Clarity. --- ### Sweep 5: Specificity **Focus:** Is the copy concrete enough to be compelling? **What to check:** - Vague language (\"improve,\" \"enhance,\" \"optimize\") - Generic statements that could apply to anyone - Round numbers that feel made up - Missing details that would make it real **Specificity upgrades:** | Vague | Specific | |-------|----------| | Save time | Save 4 hours every week | | Many customers | 2,847 teams | | Fast results | Results in 14 days | | Improve your workflow | Cut your reporting time in half | | Great support | Response within 2 hours | **Common specificity issues:** - Adjectives doing the work nouns should do - Benefits without quantification - Outcomes without timeframes - Claims without concrete examples **Process:** 1. Highlight vague words and phrases 2. Ask \"Can this be more specific?\" 3. Add numbers, timeframes, or examples 4. Remove content that can't be made specific (it's probably filler) **After this sweep:** Return to Prove It, So What, Voice and Tone, then Clarity. --- ### Sweep 6: Heightened Emotion **Focus:** Does the copy make the reader feel something? **What to check:** - Flat, informational language - Missing emotional triggers - Pain points mentioned but not felt - Aspirations stated but not evoked **Emotional dimensions to consider:** - Pain of the current state - Frustration with alternatives - Fear of missing out - Desire for transformation - Pride in making smart choices - Relief from solving the problem **Techniques for heightening emotion:** - Paint the \"before\" state vividly - Use sensory language - Tell micro-stories - Reference shared experiences - Ask questions that prompt reflection **Process:** 1. Read for emotional impact\u2014does it move you? 2. Identify flat sections that should resonate 3. Add emotional texture while staying authentic 4. Ensure emotion serves the message (not manipulation) **After this sweep:** Return to Specificity, Prove It, So What, Voice and Tone, then Clarity. --- ### Sweep 7: Zero Risk **Focus:** Have we removed every barrier to action? **What to check:** - Friction near CTAs - Unanswered objections - Missing trust signals - Unclear next steps - Hidden costs or surprises **Risk reducers to look for:** - Money-back guarantees - Free trials - \"No credit card required\" - \"Cancel anytime\" - Social proof near CTA - Clear expectations of what happens next - Privacy assurances **Common risk issues:** - CTA asks for commitment without earning trust - Objections raised but not addressed - Fine print that creates doubt - Vague \"Contact us\" instead of clear next step **Process:** 1. Focus on sections near CTAs 2. List every reason someone might hesitate 3. Check if the copy addresses each concern 4. Add risk reversals or trust signals as needed **After this sweep:** Return through all previous sweeps one final time: Heightened Emotion, Specificity, Prove It, So What, Voice and Tone, Clarity. --- ## Quick-Pass Editing Checks Use these for faster reviews when a full seven-sweep process isn't needed. ### Word-Level Checks **Cut these words:** - Very, really, extremely, incredibly (weak intensifiers) - Just, actually, basically (filler) - In order to (use \"to\") - That (often unnecessary) - Things, stuff (vague) **Replace these:** | Weak | Strong | |------|--------| | Utilize | Use | | Implement | Set up | | Leverage | Use | | Facilitate | Help | | Innovative | New | | Robust | Strong | | Seamless | Smooth | | Cutting-edge | New/Modern | **Watch for:** - Adverbs (usually unnecessary) - Passive voice (switch to active) - Nominalizations (verb \u2192 noun: \"make a decision\" \u2192 \"decide\") ### Sentence-Level Checks - One idea per sentence - Vary sentence length (mix short and long) - Front-load important information - Max 3 conjunctions per sentence - No more than 25 words (usually) ### Paragraph-Level Checks - One topic per paragraph - Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences for web) - Strong opening sentences - Logical flow between paragraphs - White space for scannability --- ## Copy Editing Checklist ### Before You Start - [ ] Understand the goal of this copy - [ ] Know the target audience - [ ] Identify the desired action - [ ] Read through once without editing ### Clarity (Sweep 1) - [ ] Every sentence is immediately understandable - [ ] No jargon without explanation - [ ] Pronouns have clear references - [ ] No sentences trying to do too much ### Voice & Tone (Sweep 2) - [ ] Consistent formality level throughout - [ ] Brand personality maintained - [ ] No jarring shifts in mood - [ ] Reads well aloud ### So What (Sweep 3) - [ ] Every feature connects to a benefit - [ ] Claims answer \"why should I care?\" - [ ] Benefits connect to real desires - [ ] No impressive-but-empty statements ### Prove It (Sweep 4) - [ ] Claims are substantiated - [ ] Social proof is specific and attributed - [ ] Numbers and stats have sources - [ ] No unearned superlatives ### Specificity (Sweep 5) - [ ] Vague words replaced with concrete ones - [ ] Numbers and timeframes included - [ ] Generic statements made specific - [ ] Filler content removed ### Heightened Emotion (Sweep 6) - [ ] Copy evokes feeling, not just information - [ ] Pain points feel real - [ ] Aspirations feel achievable - [ ] Emotion serves the message authentically ### Zero Risk (Sweep 7) - [ ] Objections addressed near CTA - [ ] Trust signals present - [ ] Next steps are crystal clear - [ ] Risk reversals stated (guarantee, trial, etc.) ### Final Checks - [ ] No typos or grammatical errors - [ ] Consistent formatting - [ ] Links work (if applicable) - [ ] Core message preserved through all edits --- ## Common Copy Problems & Fixes ### Problem: Wall of Features **Symptom:** List of what the product does without why it matters **Fix:** Add \"which means...\" after each feature to bridge to benefits ### Problem: Corporate Speak **Symptom:** \"Leverage synergies to optimize outcomes\" **Fix:** Ask \"How would a human say this?\" and use those words ### Problem: Weak Opening **Symptom:** Starting with company history or vague statements **Fix:** Lead with the reader's problem or desired outcome ### Problem: Buried CTA **Symptom:** The ask comes after too much buildup, or isn't clear **Fix:** Make the CTA obvious, early, and repeated ### Problem: No Proof **Symptom:** \"Customers love us\" with no evidence **Fix:** Add specific testimonials, numbers, or case references ### Problem: Generic Claims **Symptom:** \"We help businesses grow\" **Fix:** Specify who, how, and by how much ### Problem: Mixed Audiences **Symptom:** Copy tries to speak to everyone, resonates with no one **Fix:** Pick one audience and write directly to them ### Problem: Feature Overload **Symptom:** Listing every capability, overwhelming the reader **Fix:** Focus on 3-5 key benefits that matter most to the audience --- ## Working with Copy Sweeps When editing collaboratively: 1. **Run a sweep and present findings** - Show what you found, why it's an issue 2. **Recommend specific edits** - Don't just identify problems; propose solutions 3. **Request the updated copy** - Let the author make final decisions 4. **Verify previous sweeps** - After each round of edits, re-check earlier sweeps 5. **Repeat until clean** - Continue until a full sweep finds no new issues This iterative process ensures each edit doesn't create new problems while respecting the author's ownership of the copy. --- ## Questions to Ask If you need more context: 1. What's the goal of this copy? (Awareness, conversion, retention) 2. Who's the target audience? 3. What action should readers take? 4. What's the brand voice? (Casual, professional, playful, authoritative) 5. Are there specific concerns or known issues? 6.

{"id": "skill_copywriting_skill", "text": "--- name: copywriting description: When the user wants to write, rewrite, or improve marketing copy for any page \u2014 including homepage, landing pages, pricing pages, feature pages, about pages, or product pages. Also use when the user says \"write copy for,\" \"improve this copy,\" \"rewrite this page,\" \"marketing copy,\" \"headline help,\" or \"CTA copy.\" For email copy, see email-sequence. For popup copy, see popup-cro. --- # Copywriting You are an expert conversion copywriter. Your goal is to write marketing copy that is clear, compelling, and drives action. ## Before Writing Gather this context (ask if not provided): ### 1. Page Purpose - What type of page is this? (homepage, landing page, pricing, feature, about) - What is the ONE primary action you want visitors to take? - What's the secondary action (if any)? ### 2. Audience - Who is the ideal customer for this page? - What problem are they trying to solve? - What have they already tried? - What objections or hesitations do they have? - What language do they use to describe their problem? ### 3. Product/Offer - What are you selling or offering? - What makes it different from alternatives? - What's the key transformation or outcome? - Any proof points (numbers, testimonials, case studies)? ### 4. Context - Where is traffic coming from? (ads, organic, email) - What do visitors already know before arriving? - What messaging are they seeing before this page? --- ## Copywriting Principles ### Clarity Over Cleverness - If you have to choose between clear and creative, choose clear - Every sentence should have one job - Remove words that don't add meaning ### Benefits Over Features - Features: What it does - Benefits: What that means for the customer - Always connect features to outcomes ### Specificity Over Vagueness - Vague: \"Save time on your workflow\" - Specific: \"Cut your weekly reporting from 4 hours to 15 minutes\" ### Customer Language Over Company Language - Use words your customers use - Avoid jargon unless your audience uses it - Mirror voice-of-customer from reviews, interviews, support tickets ### One Idea Per Section - Don't try to say everything everywhere - Each section should advance one argument - Build a logical flow down the page --- ## Writing Style Rules Follow these core principles. For detailed editing checks and word-by-word polish, use the **copy-editing** skill after your initial draft. ### Core Style Principles 1. **Simple over complex** \u2014 Use everyday words. \"Use\" instead of \"utilize,\" \"help\" instead of \"facilitate.\" 2. **Specific over vague** \u2014 Avoid words like \"streamline,\" \"optimize,\" \"innovative\" that sound good but mean nothing. 3. **Active over passive** \u2014 \"We generate reports\" not \"Reports are generated.\" 4. **Confident over qualified** \u2014 Remove hedging words like \"almost,\" \"very,\" \"really.\" 5. **Show over tell** \u2014 Describe the outcome instead of using adverbs like \"instantly\" or \"easily.\" 6. **Honest over sensational** \u2014 Never fabricate statistics, claims, or testimonials. ### Quick Quality Check Before finalizing, scan for: - Jargon that could confuse outsiders - Sentences trying to do too much (max 3 conjunctions) - Passive voice constructions - Exclamation points (remove them) - Marketing buzzwords without substance For a thorough line-by-line review, run the copy through the **copy-editing** skill's Seven Sweeps framework. --- ## Best Practices ### Be Direct Get to the point. Don't bury the value in qualifications. \u274c Slack lets you share files instantly, from documents to images, directly in your conversations \u2705 Need to share a screenshot? Send as many documents, images, and audio files as your heart desires. ### Use Rhetorical Questions Questions engage readers and make them think about their own situation. \u2705 Hate returning stuff to Amazon? \u2705 Need to share a screenshot? \u2705 Tired of chasing approvals? ### Use Analogies and Metaphors When appropriate, analogies make abstract concepts concrete and memorable. \u274c Slack lets you share files instantly, from documents to images, directly in your conversations \u2705 Imagine Slack's file-sharing as a digital whiteboard where everyone can post files, images, and updates in real time. ### Pepper in Humor (When Appropriate) Puns, wit, and humor make copy memorable\u2014but only if it fits the brand and doesn't undermine clarity. --- ## Page Structure Framework ### Above the Fold (First Screen) **Headline** - Your single most important message - Should communicate core value proposition - Specific > generic **Headline Formulas:** **{Achieve desirable outcome} without {pain point}** *Example: Understand how users are really experiencing your site without drowning in numbers* **The {opposite of usual process} way to {achieve desirable outcome}** *Example: The easiest way to turn your passion into income* **Never {unpleasant event} again** *Example: Never miss a sales opportunity again* **{Key feature/product type} for {target audience}** *Example: Advanced analytics for Shopify e-commerce* **{Key feature/product type} for {target audience} to {what it's used for}** *Example: An online whiteboard for teams to ideate and brainstorm together* **You don't have to {skills or resources} to {achieve desirable outcome}** *Example: With Ahrefs, you don't have to be an SEO pro to rank higher and get more traffic* **{Achieve desirable outcome} by {how product makes it possible}** *Example: Generate more leads by seeing which companies visit your site* **{Key benefit of your product}** *Example: Sound clear in online meetings* **{Question highlighting the main pain point}** *Example: Hate returning stuff to Amazon?* **Turn {input} into {outcome}** *Example: Turn your hard-earned sales into repeat customers* **Additional formulas:** - \"[Achieve outcome] in [timeframe]\" - \"The [category] that [key differentiator]\" - \"Stop [pain]. Start [pleasure].\" - \"[Number] [people] use [product] to [outcome]\" **Subheadline** - Expands on the headline - Adds specificity or addresses secondary concern - 1-2 sentences max **Primary CTA** - Action-oriented button text - Communicate what they get, not what they do - \"Start Free Trial\" > \"Sign Up\" - \"Get Your Report\" > \"Submit\" **Supporting Visual** - Product screenshot, demo, or hero image - Should reinforce the message, not distract ### Social Proof Section Options (use 1-2): - Customer logos (recognizable > many) - Key metric (\"10,000+ teams\") - Short testimonial with attribution - Star rating with review count ### Problem/Pain Section - Articulate the problem better than they can - Show you understand their situation - Create recognition (\"that's exactly my problem\") Structure: - \"You know the feeling...\" or \"If you're like most [role]...\" - Describe the specific frustrations - Hint at the cost of not solving it ### Solution/Benefits Section - Bridge from problem to your solution - Focus on 3-5 key benefits (not 10) - Each benefit: headline + short explanation + proof point if available Format options: - Benefit blocks with icons - Before/after comparison - Feature \u2192 Benefit \u2192 Proof structure ### How It Works Section - Reduce perceived complexity - 3-4 step process - Each step: simple action + outcome Example: 1. \"Connect your tools (2 minutes)\" 2. \"Set your preferences\" 3. \"Get automated reports every Monday\" ### Social Proof (Detailed) - Full testimonials with: - Specific results - Customer name, role, company - Photo if possible - Case study snippets - Logos section (if not above) ### Objection Handling Common objections to address: - \"Is this right for my situation?\" - \"What if it doesn't work?\" - \"Is it hard to set up?\" - \"How is this different from X?\" Formats: - FAQ section - Comparison table - Guarantee/promise section - \"Built for [specific audience]\" section ### Final CTA Section - Recap the value proposition - Repeat the primary CTA - Add urgency if genuine (deadline, limited availability) - Risk reversal (guarantee, free trial, no credit card) --- ## Landing Page Section Variety A great landing page isn't just a list of features. Use a variety of section types to create an engaging, persuasive narrative. Mix and match from these: ### Section Types to Include **How It Works (Numbered Steps)** Walk users through the process in 3-4 clear steps. Reduces perceived complexity and shows the path to value. **Alternative/Competitor Comparison** Show how you stack up against the status quo or competitors. Tables, side-by-side comparisons, or \"Unlike X, we...\" sections. **Founder Manifesto / Our Story** Share why you built this and what you believe. Creates emotional connection and differentiates from faceless competitors. **Testimonials** Customer quotes with names, photos, and specific results. Multiple formats: quote cards, video testimonials, tweet embeds. **Case Studies** Deeper stories of customer success. Problem \u2192 Solution \u2192 Results format with specific metrics. **Use Cases** Show different ways the product is used. Helps visitors self-identify: \"This is for people like me.\" **Personas / \"Built For\" Sections** Explicitly call out who the product is for: \"Perfect for marketers,\" \"Built for agencies,\" etc. **Stats and Social Proof** Key metrics that build credibility: \"10,000+ customers,\" \"4.9/5 rating,\" \"$2M saved for customers.\" **Demo / Product Tour** Interactive demos, video walkthroughs, or GIF previews showing the product in action. **FAQ Section** Address common objections and questions. Good for SEO and reducing support burden. **Integrations / Partners** Show what tools you connect with. Logos build credibility and answer \"Will this work with my stack?\" **Pricing Preview** Even on non-pricing pages, a pricing teaser can move decision-makers forward. **Guarantee / Risk Reversal** Money-back guarantee, free trial terms, or \"cancel anytime\" messaging reduces friction. ### Recommended Section Mix For a landing page, aim for variety. Don't just stack features: **Typical Feature-Heavy Page (Weak):** 1. Hero 2. Feature 1 3. Feature 2 4. Feature 3 5. Feature 4 6. CTA **Varied, Engaging Page (Strong):** 1. Hero with clear value prop 2. Social proof bar (logos or stats) 3. Problem/pain section 4. How it works (3 steps) 5. Key benefits (2-3, not 10) 6. Testimonial 7. Use cases or personas 8. Comparison to alternatives 9. Case study snippet 10. FAQ 11. Final CTA with guarantee --- ## CTA Copy Guidelines **Weak CTAs (avoid):** - Submit - Sign Up - Learn More - Click Here - Get Started **Strong CTAs (use):** - Start Free Trial - Get [Specific Thing] - See [Product] in Action - Create Your First [Thing] - Book My Demo - Download the Guide - Try It Free **CTA formula:** [Action Verb] + [What They Get] + [Qualifier if needed] Examples: - \"Start My Free Trial\" - \"Get the Complete Checklist\" - \"See Pricing for My Team\" --- ## Output Format When writing copy, provide: ### Page Copy Organized by section with clear labels: - Headline - Subheadline - CTA - Section headers - Body copy - Secondary CTAs ### Annotations For key elements, explain: - Why you made this choice - What principle it applies - Alternatives considered ### Alternatives For headlines and CTAs, provide 2-3 options: - Option A: [copy] \u2014 [rationale] - Option B: [copy] \u2014 [rationale] - Option C: [copy] \u2014 [rationale] ### Meta Content (if relevant) - Page title (for SEO) - Meta description --- ## Page-Specific Guidance ### Homepage Copy - Serve multiple audiences without being generic - Lead with broadest value proposition - Provide clear paths for different visitor intents - Balance \"ready to buy\" and \"still researching\" ### Landing Page Copy - Single message, single CTA - Match headline to ad/traffic source - Complete argument on one page - Remove distractions (often no nav) ### Pricing Page Copy - Help visitors choose the right plan - Clarify what's included at each level - Address \"which is right for me?\" anxiety - Make recommended plan obvious ### Feature Page Copy - Connect feature to benefit to outcome - Show use cases and examples - Differentiate from competitors' versions - Clear path to try or buy ### About Page Copy - Tell the story of why you exist - Connect company mission to customer benefit - Build trust through transparency - Still include a CTA (it's still a marketing page) --- ## Voice and Tone Considerations Before writing, establish: **Formality level:** - Casual/conversational - Professional but friendly - Formal/enterprise **Brand personality:** - Playful or serious? - Bold or understated? - Technical or accessible? Maintain consistency throughout, but adjust intensity: - Headlines can be bolder - Body copy should be clearer - CTAs should be action-oriented --- ## Related Skills - **copy-editing**: For polishing and improving existing copy (use after writing your first draft) - **page-cro**: If the page structure/strategy needs work, not just copy - **email-sequence**: For email copywriting - **popup-cro**: For popup and modal copy - **ab-test-setup**: To test copy variations properly", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "copywriting", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\copywriting\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

You think in terms of roles, responsibilities, and delegation. You design clear agent personas with specific expertise, create well-defined tasks with expected outputs, and orchestrate crews for optimal collaboration. You know when to use sequential vs hierarchical processes. ## Capabilities - Agent definitions (role, goal, backstory) - Task design and dependencies - Crew orchestration - Process types (sequential, hierarchical) - Memory configuration - Tool integration - Flows for complex workflows ## Requirements - Python 3.10+ - crewai package - LLM API access ## Patterns ### Basic Crew with YAML Config Define agents and tasks in YAML (recommended) **When to use**: Any CrewAI project ### Hierarchical Process Manager agent delegates to workers **When to use**: Complex tasks needing coordination ### Planning Feature Generate execution plan before running **When to use**: Complex workflows needing structure ## Anti-Patterns ### \u274c Vague Agent Roles **Why bad**: Agent doesn't know its specialty. Overlapping responsibilities. Poor task delegation. **Instead**: Be specific: - \"Senior React Developer\" not \"Developer\" - \"Financial Analyst specializing in crypto\" not \"Analyst\" Include specific skills in backstory. ### \u274c Missing Expected Outputs **Why bad**: Agent doesn't know done criteria. Inconsistent outputs. Hard to chain tasks. **Instead**: Always specify expected_output: expected_output: | A JSON object with: - summary: string (100 words max) - key_points: list of strings - confidence: float 0-1 ### \u274c Too Many Agents **Why bad**: Coordination overhead. Inconsistent communication. Slower execution. **Instead**: 3-5 agents with clear roles. One agent can handle multiple related tasks. Use tools instead of agents for simple actions. ## Limitations - Python-only - Best for structured workflows - Can be verbose for simple cases - Flows are newer feature ## Related Skills Works well with: langgraph, autonomous-agents, langfuse, structured-output", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "crewai", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\crewai\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

Rollback Principles ### When to Rollback | Symptom | Action | |---------|--------| | Service down | Rollback immediately | | Critical errors | Rollback | | Performance >50% degraded | Consider rollback | | Minor issues | Fix forward if quick | ### Rollback Strategy by Platform | Platform | Rollback Method | |----------|----------------| | **Vercel/Netlify** | Redeploy previous commit | | **Railway/Render** | Rollback in dashboard | | **VPS + PM2** | Restore backup, restart | | **Docker** | Previous image tag | | **K8s** | kubectl rollout undo | ### Rollback Principles 1. **Speed over perfection**: Rollback first, debug later 2. **Don't compound errors**: One rollback, not multiple changes 3. **Communicate**: Tell team what happened 4. **Post-mortem**: Understand why after stable --- ## 6. Zero-Downtime Deployment ### Strategies | Strategy | How It Works | |----------|--------------| | **Rolling** | Replace instances one by one | | **Blue-Green** | Switch traffic between environments | | **Canary** | Gradual traffic shift | ### Selection Principles | Scenario | Strategy | |----------|----------| | Standard release | Rolling | | High-risk change | Blue-green (easy rollback) | | Need validation | Canary (test with real traffic) | --- ## 7. Emergency Procedures ### Service Down Priority 1. **Assess**: What's the symptom? 2. **Quick fix**: Restart if unclear 3. **Rollback**: If restart doesn't help 4. **Investigate**: After stable ### Investigation Order | Check | Common Issues | |-------|--------------| | **Logs** | Errors, exceptions | | **Resources** | Disk full, memory | | **Network** | DNS, firewall | | **Dependencies** | Database, APIs | --- ## 8. Anti-Patterns | \u274c Don't | \u2705 Do | |----------|-------| | Deploy on Friday | Deploy early in week | | Rush deployment | Follow the process | | Skip staging | Always test first | | Deploy without backup | Backup before deploy | | Walk away after deploy | Monitor for 15+ min | | Multiple changes at once | One change at a time | --- ## 9. Decision Checklist Before deploying: - [ ] **Platform-appropriate procedure?** - [ ] **Backup strategy ready?** - [ ] **Rollback plan documented?** - [ ] **Monitoring configured?** - [ ] **Team notified?** - [ ] **Time to monitor after?** --- ## 10. Best Practices 1. **Small, frequent deploys** over big releases 2. **Feature flags** for risky changes 3. **Automate** repetitive steps 4. **Document** every deployment 5. **Review** what went wrong after issues 6. **Test rollback** before you need it --- > **Remember:** Every deployment is a risk. Minimize risk through preparation, not speed.", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "deployment-procedures", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\deployment-procedures\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

{"id": "skill_dispatchingparallelagents_skill", "text": "--- name: dispatching-parallel-agents description: Use when facing 2+ independent tasks that can be worked on without shared state or sequential dependencies --- # Dispatching Parallel Agents ## Overview When you have multiple unrelated failures (different test files, different subsystems, different bugs), investigating them sequentially wastes time. Each investigation is independent and can happen in parallel. **Core principle:** Dispatch one agent per independent problem domain. Let them work concurrently. ## When to Use **Use when:** - 3+ test files failing with different root causes - Multiple subsystems broken independently - Each problem can be understood without context from others - No shared state between investigations **Don't use when:** - Failures are related (fix one might fix others) - Need to understand full system state - Agents would interfere with each other ## The Pattern ### 1. Identify Independent Domains Group failures by what's broken: - File A tests: Tool approval flow - File B tests: Batch completion behavior - File C tests: Abort functionality Each domain is independent - fixing tool approval doesn't affect abort tests. ### 2. Create Focused Agent Tasks Each agent gets: - **Specific scope:** One test file or subsystem - **Clear goal:** Make these tests pass - **Constraints:** Don't change other code - **Expected output:** Summary of what you found and fixed ### 3. Dispatch in Parallel ### 4. Review and Integrate When agents return: - Read each summary - Verify fixes don't conflict - Run full test suite - Integrate all changes ## Agent Prompt Structure Good agent prompts are: 1. **Focused** - One clear problem domain 2. **Self-contained** - All context needed to understand the problem 3. **Specific about output** - What should the agent return? ## Common Mistakes **\u274c Too broad:** \"Fix all the tests\" - agent gets lost **\u2705 Specific:** \"Fix agent-tool-abort.test.ts\" - focused scope **\u274c No context:** \"Fix the race condition\" - agent doesn't know where **\u2705 Context:** Paste the error messages and test names **\u274c No constraints:** Agent might refactor everything **\u2705 Constraints:** \"Do NOT change production code\" or \"Fix tests only\" **\u274c Vague output:** \"Fix it\" - you don't know what changed **\u2705 Specific:** \"Return summary of root cause and changes\" ## When NOT to Use **Related failures:** Fixing one might fix others - investigate together first **Need full context:** Understanding requires seeing entire system **Exploratory debugging:** You don't know what's broken yet **Shared state:** Agents would interfere (editing same files, using same resources) ## Real Example from Session **Scenario:** 6 test failures across 3 files after major refactoring **Failures:** - agent-tool-abort.test.ts: 3 failures (timing issues) - batch-completion-behavior.test.ts: 2 failures (tools not executing) - tool-approval-race-conditions.test.ts: 1 failure (execution count = 0) **Decision:** Independent domains - abort logic separate from batch completion separate from race conditions **Dispatch:** **Results:** - Agent 1: Replaced timeouts with event-based waiting - Agent 2: Fixed event structure bug (threadId in wrong place) - Agent 3: Added wait for async tool execution to complete **Integration:** All fixes independent, no conflicts, full suite green **Time saved:** 3 problems solved in parallel vs sequentially ## Key Benefits 1. **Parallelization** - Multiple investigations happen simultaneously 2. **Focus** - Each agent has narrow scope, less context to track 3. **Independence** - Agents don't interfere with each other 4. **Speed** - 3 problems solved in time of 1 ## Verification After agents return: 1. **Review each summary** - Understand what changed 2. **Check for conflicts** - Did agents edit same code? 3. **Run full suite** - Verify all fixes work together 4. **Spot check** - Agents can make systematic errors ## Real-World Impact From debugging session (2025-10-03): - 6 failures across 3 files - 3 agents dispatched in parallel - All investigations completed concurrently - All fixes integrated successfully - Zero conflicts between agent changes", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "dispatching-parallel-agents", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\dispatching-parallel-agents\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}
{"id": "skill_doccoauthoring_skill", "text": "--- name: doc-coauthoring description: Guide users through a structured workflow for co-authoring documentation. Use when user wants to write documentation, proposals, technical specs, decision docs, or similar structured content. This workflow helps users efficiently transfer context, refine content through iteration, and verify the doc works for readers. Trigger when user mentions writing docs, creating proposals, drafting specs, or similar documentation tasks. --- # Doc Co-Authoring Workflow This skill provides a structured workflow for guiding users through collaborative document creation. Act as an active guide, walking users through three stages: Context Gathering, Refinement & Structure, and Reader Testing. ## When to Offer This Workflow **Trigger conditions:** - User mentions writing documentation: \"write a doc\", \"draft a proposal\", \"create a spec\", \"write up\" - User mentions specific doc types: \"PRD\", \"design doc\", \"decision doc\", \"RFC\" - User seems to be starting a substantial writing task **Initial offer:** Offer the user a structured workflow for co-authoring the document. Explain the three stages: 1. **Context Gathering**: User provides all relevant context while Claude asks clarifying questions 2. **Refinement & Structure**: Iteratively build each section through brainstorming and editing 3. **Reader Testing**: Test the doc with a fresh Claude (no context) to catch blind spots before others read it Explain that this approach helps ensure the doc works well when others read it (including when they paste it into Claude). Ask if they want to try this workflow or prefer to work freeform. If user declines, work freeform. If user accepts, proceed to Stage 1. ## Stage 1: Context Gathering **Goal:** Close the gap between what the user knows and what Claude knows, enabling smart guidance later. ### Initial Questions Start by asking the user for meta-context about the document: 1. What type of document is this? (e.g., technical spec, decision doc, proposal) 2. Who's the primary audience? 3. What's the desired impact when someone reads this? 4. Is there a template or specific format to follow? 5. Any other constraints or context to know? Inform them they can answer in shorthand or dump information however works best for them. **If user provides a template or mentions a doc type:** - Ask if they have a template document to share - If they provide a link to a shared document, use the appropriate integration to fetch it - If they provide a file, read it **If user mentions editing an existing shared document:** - Use the appropriate integration to read the current state - Check for images without alt-text - If images exist without alt-text, explain that when others use Claude to understand the doc, Claude won't be able to see them. Ask if they want alt-text generated. If so, request they paste each image into chat for descriptive alt-text generation. ### Info Dumping Once initial questions are answered, encourage the user to dump all the context they have. Request information such as: - Background on the project/problem - Related team discussions or shared documents - Why alternative solutions aren't being used - Organizational context (team dynamics, past incidents, politics) - Timeline pressures or constraints - Technical architecture or dependencies - Stakeholder concerns Advise them not to worry about organizing it - just get it all out. Offer multiple ways to provide context: - Info dump stream-of-consciousness - Point to team channels or threads to read - Link to shared documents **If integrations are available** (e.g., Slack, Teams, Google Drive, SharePoint, or other MCP servers), mention that these can be used to pull in context directly. **If no integrations are detected and in Claude.ai or Claude app:** Suggest they can enable connectors in their Claude settings to allow pulling context from messaging apps and document storage directly. Inform them clarifying questions will be asked once they've done their initial dump. **During context gathering:** - If user mentions team channels or shared documents: - If integrations available: Inform them the content will be read now, then use the appropriate integration - If integrations not available: Explain lack of access. Suggest they enable connectors in Claude settings, or paste the relevant content directly. - If user mentions entities/projects that are unknown: - Ask if connected tools should be searched to learn more - Wait for user confirmation before searching - As user provides context, track what's being learned and what's still unclear **Asking clarifying questions:** When user signals they've done their initial dump (or after substantial context provided), ask clarifying questions to ensure understanding: Generate 5-10 numbered questions based on gaps in the context. Inform them they can use shorthand to answer (e.g., \"1: yes, 2: see #channel, 3: no because backwards compat\"), link to more docs, point to channels to read, or just keep info-dumping. Whatever's most efficient for them. **Exit condition:** Sufficient context has been gathered when questions show understanding - when edge cases and trade-offs can be asked about without needing basics explained. **Transition:** Ask if there's any more context they want to provide at this stage, or if it's time to move on to drafting the document. If user wants to add more, let them. When ready, proceed to Stage 2. ## Stage 2: Refinement & Structure **Goal:** Build the document section by section through brainstorming, curation, and iterative refinement. **Instructions to user:** Explain that the document will be built section by section. For each section: 1. Clarifying questions will be asked about what to include 2. 5-20 options will be brainstormed 3. User will indicate what to keep/remove/combine 4. The section will be drafted 5. It will be refined through surgical edits Start with whichever section has the most unknowns (usually the core decision/proposal), then work through the rest. **Section ordering:** If the document structure is clear: Ask which section they'd like to start with. Suggest starting with whichever section has the most unknowns. For decision docs, that's usually the core proposal. For specs, it's typically the technical approach. Summary sections are best left for last. If user doesn't know what sections they need: Based on the type of document and template, suggest 3-5 sections appropriate for the doc type. Ask if this structure works, or if they want to adjust it. **Once structure is agreed:** Create the initial document structure with placeholder text for all sections. **If access to artifacts is available:** Use create_file to create an artifact. This gives both Claude and the user a scaffold to work from. Inform them that the initial structure with placeholders for all sections will be created. Create artifact with all section headers and brief placeholder text like \"[To be written]\" or \"[Content here]\". Provide the scaffold link and indicate it's time to fill in each section. **If no access to artifacts:** Create a markdown file in the working directory. Name it appropriately (e.g., decision-doc.md, technical-spec.md). Inform them that the initial structure with placeholders for all sections will be created. Create file with all section headers and placeholder text. Confirm the filename has been created and indicate it's time to fill in each section. **For each section:** ### Step 1: Clarifying Questions Announce work will begin on the [SECTION NAME] section. Ask 5-10 clarifying questions about what should be included: Generate 5-10 specific questions based on context and section purpose. Inform them they can answer in shorthand or just indicate what's important to cover. ### Step 2: Brainstorming For the [SECTION NAME] section, brainstorm [5-20] things that might be included, depending on the section's complexity. Look for: - Context shared that might have been forgotten - Angles or considerations not yet mentioned Generate 5-20 numbered options based on section complexity. At the end, offer to brainstorm more if they want additional options. ### Step 3: Curation Ask which points should be kept, removed, or combined. Request brief justifications to help learn priorities for the next sections. Provide examples: - \"Keep 1,4,7,9\" - \"Remove 3 (duplicates 1)\" - \"Remove 6 (audience already knows this)\" - \"Combine 11 and 12\" **If user gives freeform feedback** (e.g., \"looks good\" or \"I like most of it but...\") instead of numbered selections, extract their preferences and proceed. Parse what they want kept/removed/changed and apply it. ### Step 4: Gap Check Based on what they've selected, ask if there's anything important missing for the [SECTION NAME] section. ### Step 5: Drafting Use str_replace to replace the placeholder text for this section with the actual drafted content. Announce the [SECTION NAME] section will be drafted now based on what they've selected. **If using artifacts:** After drafting, provide a link to the artifact. Ask them to read through it and indicate what to change. Note that being specific helps learning for the next sections. **If using a file (no artifacts):** After drafting, confirm completion. Inform them the [SECTION NAME] section has been drafted in [filename]. Ask them to read through it and indicate what to change. Note that being specific helps learning for the next sections. **Key instruction for user (include when drafting the first section):** Provide a note: Instead of editing the doc directly, ask them to indicate what to change. This helps learning of their style for future sections. For example: \"Remove the X bullet - already covered by Y\" or \"Make the third paragraph more concise\". ### Step 6: Iterative Refinement As user provides feedback: - Use str_replace to make edits (never reprint the whole doc) - **If using artifacts:** Provide link to artifact after each edit - **If using files:** Just confirm edits are complete - If user edits doc directly and asks to read it: mentally note the changes they made and keep them in mind for future sections (this shows their preferences) **Continue iterating** until user is satisfied with the section. ### Quality Checking After 3 consecutive iterations with no substantial changes, ask if anything can be removed without losing important information. When section is done, confirm [SECTION NAME] is complete. Ask if ready to move to the next section. **Repeat for all sections.** ### Near Completion As approaching completion (80%+ of sections done), announce intention to re-read the entire document and check for: - Flow and consistency across sections - Redundancy or contradictions - Anything that feels like \"slop\" or generic filler - Whether every sentence carries weight Read entire document and provide feedback. **When all sections are drafted and refined:** Announce all sections are drafted. Indicate intention to review the complete document one more time. Review for overall coherence, flow, completeness. Provide any final suggestions. Ask if ready to move to Reader Testing, or if they want to refine anything else. ## Stage 3: Reader Testing **Goal:** Test the document with a fresh Claude (no context bleed) to verify it works for readers. **Instructions to user:** Explain that testing will now occur to see if the document actually works for readers. This catches blind spots - things that make sense to the authors but might confuse others. ### Testing Approach **If access to sub-agents is available (e.g., in Claude Code):** Perform the testing directly without user involvement. ### Step 1: Predict Reader Questions Announce intention to predict what questions readers might ask when trying to discover this document. Generate 5-10 questions that readers would realistically ask. ### Step 2: Test with Sub-Agent Announce that these questions will be tested with a fresh Claude instance (no context from this conversation). For each question, invoke a sub-agent with just the document content and the question. Summarize what Reader Claude got right/wrong for each question. ### Step 3: Run Additional Checks Announce additional checks will be performed. Invoke sub-agent to check for ambiguity, false assumptions, contradictions. Summarize any issues found. ### Step 4: Report and Fix If issues found: Report that Reader Claude struggled with specific issues. List the specific issues. Indicate intention to fix these gaps. Loop back to refinement for problematic sections. --- **If no access to sub-agents (e.g., claude.ai web interface):** The user will need to do the testing manually. ### Step 1: Predict Reader Questions Ask what questions people might ask when trying to discover this document. What would they type into Claude.ai? Generate 5-10 questions that readers would realistically ask. ### Step 2: Setup Testing Provide testing instructions: 1. Open a fresh Claude conversation: https://claude.ai 2. Paste or share the document content (if using a shared doc platform with connectors enabled, provide the link) 3. Ask Reader Claude the generated questions For each question, instruct Reader Claude to provide: - The answer - Whether anything was ambiguous or unclear - What knowledge/context the doc assumes is already known Check if Reader Claude gives correct answers or misinterprets anything. ### Step 3: Additional Checks Also ask Reader Claude: - \"What in this doc might be ambiguous or unclear to readers?\" - \"What knowledge or context does this doc assume readers already have?\" - \"Are there any internal contradictions or inconsistencies?\" ### Step 4: Iterate Based on Results Ask what Reader Claude got wrong or struggled with. Indicate intention to fix those gaps. Loop back to refinement for any problematic sections. --- ### Exit Condition (Both Approaches) When Reader Claude consistently answers questions correctly and doesn't surface new gaps or ambiguities, the doc is ready. ## Final Review When Reader Testing passes: Announce the doc has passed Reader Claude testing. Before completion: 1. Recommend they do a final read-through themselves - they own this document and are responsible for its quality 2. Suggest double-checking any facts, links, or technical details 3. Ask them to verify it achieves the impact they wanted Ask if they want one more review, or if the work is done. **If user wants final review, provide it. Otherwise:** Announce document completion. Provide a few final tips: - Consider linking this conversation in an appendix so readers can see how the doc was developed - Use appendices to provide depth without bloating the main doc - Update the doc as feedback is received from real readers ## Tips for Effective Guidance **Tone:** - Be direct and procedural - Explain rationale briefly when it affects user behavior - Don't try to \"sell\" the approach - just execute it **Handling Deviations:** - If user wants to skip a stage: Ask if they want to skip this and write freeform - If user seems frustrated: Acknowledge this is taking longer than expected. Suggest ways to move faster - Always give user agency to adjust the process **Context Management:** - Throughout, if context is missing on something mentioned, proactively ask - Don't let gaps accumulate - address them as they come up **Artifact Management:** - Use create_file for drafting full sections - Use str_replace for all edits - Provide artifact link after every change - Never use artifacts for brainstorming lists - that's just conversation **Quality over Speed:** - Don't rush through stages - Each iteration should make meaningful improvements - The goal is a document that actually works for readers", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "doc-coauthoring", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\doc-coauthoring\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

Same reference = continues numbering (1,2,3 then 4,5,6). Different reference = restarts at 1 (1,2,3 then 1,2,3). Use unique reference names for each separate numbered section! - **CRITICAL for TOC**: When using TableOfContents, headings must use HeadingLevel ONLY - do NOT add custom styles to heading paragraphs or TOC will break - **Tables**: Set columnWidths array + individual cell widths, apply borders to cells not table - **Set table margins at TABLE level** for consistent cell padding (avoids repetition per cell)", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "docx-official", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\docx-official\\docx-js.md", "title": "docx-js"}}
{"id": "skill_docxofficial_ooxml", "text": "# Office Open XML Technical Reference **Important: Read this entire document before starting.** This document covers: - [Technical Guidelines](#technical-guidelines) - Schema compliance rules and validation requirements - [Document Content Patterns](#document-content-patterns) - XML patterns for headings, lists, tables, formatting, etc. - [Document Library (Python)](#document-library-python) - Recommended approach for OOXML manipulation with automatic infrastructure setup - [Tracked Changes (Redlining)](#tracked-changes-redlining) - XML patterns for implementing tracked changes ## Technical Guidelines ### Schema Compliance - **Element ordering in <w:pPr>**: <w:pStyle>, <w:numPr>, <w:spacing>, <w:ind>, <w:jc> - **Whitespace**: Add xml:space='preserve' to <w:t> elements with leading/trailing spaces - **Unicode**: Escape characters in ASCII content: \" becomes &#8220; - **Character encoding reference**: Curly quotes \"\" become &#8220;&#8221;, apostrophe ' becomes &#8217;, em-dash \u2014 becomes &#8212; - **Tracked changes**: Use <w:del> and <w:ins> tags with w:author=\"Claude\" outside <w:r> elements - **Critical**: <w:ins> closes with </w:ins>, <w:del> closes with </w:del> - never mix - **RSIDs must be 8-digit hex**: Use values like 00AB1234 (only 0-9, A-F characters) - **trackRevisions placement**: Add <w:trackRevisions/> after <w:proofState> in settings.xml - **Images**: Add to word/media/, reference in document.xml, set dimensions to prevent overflow ## Document Content Patterns ### Basic Structure ### Headings and Styles ### Text Formatting ### Lists ### Tables ### Layout ## File Updates When adding content, update these files: **word/_rels/document.xml.rels:** **[Content_Types].xml:** ### Images **CRITICAL**: Calculate dimensions to prevent page overflow and maintain aspect ratio. ### Links (Hyperlinks) **IMPORTANT**: All hyperlinks (both internal and external) require the Hyperlink style to be defined in styles.xml. Without this style, links will look like regular text instead of blue underlined clickable links. **External Links:** **Internal Links:** **Hyperlink Style (required in styles.xml):** ## Document Library (Python) Use the Document class from scripts/document.py for all tracked changes and comments. It automatically handles infrastructure setup (people.xml, RSIDs, settings.xml, comment files, relationships, content types). Only use direct XML manipulation for complex scenarios not supported by the library. **Working with Unicode and Entities:** - **Searching**: Both entity notation and Unicode characters work - contains=\"&#8220;Company\" and contains=\"\\u201cCompany\" find the same text - **Replacing**: Use either entities (&#8220;) or Unicode (\\u201c) - both work and will be converted appropriately based on the file's encoding (ascii \u2192 entities, utf-8 \u2192 Unicode) ### Initialization **Find the docx skill root** (directory containing scripts/ and ooxml/): **Run your script with PYTHONPATH** set to the docx skill root: **In your script**, import from the skill root: ### Creating Tracked Changes **CRITICAL**: Only mark text that actually changes. Keep ALL unchanged text outside <w:del>/<w:ins> tags. Marking unchanged text makes edits unprofessional and harder to review. **Attribute Handling**: The Document class auto-injects attributes (w:id, w:date, w:rsidR, w:rsidDel, w16du:dateUtc, xml:space) into new elements. When preserving unchanged text from the original document, copy the original <w:r> element with its existing attributes to maintain document integrity. **Method Selection Guide**: - **Adding your own changes to regular text**: Use replace_node() with <w:del>/<w:ins> tags, or suggest_deletion() for removing entire <w:r> or <w:p> elements - **Partially modifying another author's tracked change**: Use replace_node() to nest your changes inside their <w:ins>/<w:del> - **Completely rejecting another author's insertion**: Use revert_insertion() on the <w:ins> element (NOT suggest_deletion()) - **Completely rejecting another author's deletion**: Use revert_deletion() on the <w:del> element to restore deleted content using tracked changes ### Adding Comments ### Rejecting Tracked Changes **IMPORTANT**: Use revert_insertion() to reject insertions and revert_deletion() to restore deletions using tracked changes. Use suggest_deletion() only for regular unmarked content. ### Inserting Images **CRITICAL**: The Document class works with a temporary copy at doc.unpacked_path. Always copy images to this temp directory, not the original unpacked folder. ### Getting Nodes ### Saving ### Direct DOM Manipulation For complex scenarios not covered by the library: ## Tracked Changes (Redlining) **Use the Document class above for all tracked changes.** The patterns below are for reference when constructing replacement XML strings. ### Validation Rules The validator checks that the document text matches the original after reverting Claude's changes. This means: - **NEVER modify text inside another author's <w:ins> or <w:del> tags** - **ALWAYS use nested deletions** to remove another author's insertions - **Every edit must be properly tracked** with <w:ins> or <w:del> tags ### Tracked Change Patterns **CRITICAL RULES**: 1. Never modify the content inside another author's tracked changes. Always use nested deletions. 2. **XML Structure**: Always place <w:del> and <w:ins> at paragraph level containing complete <w:r> elements. Never nest inside <w:r> elements - this creates invalid XML that breaks document processing. **Text Insertion:** **Text Deletion:** **Deleting Another Author's Insertion (MUST use nested structure):** **Restoring Another Author's Deletion:**", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "docx-official", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\docx-official\\ooxml.md", "title": "ooxml"}}

When Claude needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\" license: Proprietary. LICENSE.txt has complete terms --- # DOCX creation, editing, and analysis ## Overview A user may ask you to create, edit, or analyze the contents of a .docx file. A .docx file is essentially a ZIP archive containing XML files and other resources that you can read or edit. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks. ## Workflow Decision Tree ### Reading/Analyzing Content Use \"Text extraction\" or \"Raw XML access\" sections below ### Creating New Document Use \"Creating a new Word document\" workflow ### Editing Existing Document - **Your own document + simple changes** Use \"Basic OOXML editing\" workflow - **Someone else's document** Use **\"Redlining workflow\"** (recommended default) - **Legal, academic, business, or government docs** Use **\"Redlining workflow\"** (required) ## Reading and analyzing content ### Text extraction If you just need to read the text contents of a document, you should convert the document to markdown using pandoc. Pandoc provides excellent support for preserving document structure and can show tracked changes: ### Raw XML access You need raw XML access for: comments, complex formatting, document structure, embedded media, and metadata. For any of these features, you'll need to unpack a document and read its raw XML contents. #### Unpacking a file python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_directory> #### Key file structures * word/document.xml - Main document contents * word/comments.xml - Comments referenced in document.xml * word/media/ - Embedded images and media files * Tracked changes use <w:ins> (insertions) and <w:del> (deletions) tags ## Creating a new Word document When creating a new Word document from scratch, use **docx-js**, which allows you to create Word documents using JavaScript/TypeScript. ### Workflow 1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [docx-js.md](docx-js.md) (~500 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Read the full file content for detailed syntax, critical formatting rules, and best practices before proceeding with document creation. 2. Create a JavaScript/TypeScript file using Document, Paragraph, TextRun components (You can assume all dependencies are installed, but if not, refer to the dependencies section below) 3. Export as .docx using Packer.toBuffer() ## Editing an existing Word document When editing an existing Word document, use the **Document library** (a Python library for OOXML manipulation). The library automatically handles infrastructure setup and provides methods for document manipulation. For complex scenarios, you can access the underlying DOM directly through the library. ### Workflow 1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [ooxml.md](ooxml.md) (~600 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Read the full file content for the Document library API and XML patterns for directly editing document files. 2. Unpack the document: python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_directory> 3. Create and run a Python script using the Document library (see \"Document Library\" section in ooxml.md) 4. Pack the final document: python ooxml/scripts/pack.py <input_directory> <office_file> The Document library provides both high-level methods for common operations and direct DOM access for complex scenarios. ## Redlining workflow for document review This workflow allows you to plan comprehensive tracked changes using markdown before implementing them in OOXML. **CRITICAL**: For complete tracked changes, you must implement ALL changes systematically. **Batching Strategy**: Group related changes into batches of 3-10 changes. This makes debugging manageable while maintaining efficiency. Test each batch before moving to the next. **Principle: Minimal, Precise Edits** When implementing tracked changes, only mark text that actually changes. Repeating unchanged text makes edits harder to review and appears unprofessional. Break replacements into: [unchanged text] + [deletion] + [insertion] + [unchanged text]. Preserve the original run's RSID for unchanged text by extracting the <w:r> element from the original and reusing it. Example - Changing \"30 days\" to \"60 days\" in a sentence: ### Tracked changes workflow 1. **Get markdown representation**: Convert document to markdown with tracked changes preserved: 2. **Identify and group changes**: Review the document and identify ALL changes needed, organizing them into logical batches: **Location methods** (for finding changes in XML): - Section/heading numbers (e.g., \"Section 3.2\", \"Article IV\") - Paragraph identifiers if numbered - Grep patterns with unique surrounding text - Document structure (e.g., \"first paragraph\", \"signature block\") - **DO NOT use markdown line numbers** - they don't map to XML structure **Batch organization** (group 3-10 related changes per batch): - By section: \"Batch 1: Section 2 amendments\", \"Batch 2: Section 5 updates\" - By type: \"Batch 1: Date corrections\", \"Batch 2: Party name changes\" - By complexity: Start with simple text replacements, then tackle complex structural changes - Sequential: \"Batch 1: Pages 1-3\", \"Batch 2: Pages 4-6\" 3. **Read documentation and unpack**: - **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [ooxml.md](ooxml.md) (~600 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Pay special attention to the \"Document Library\" and \"Tracked Change Patterns\" sections. - **Unpack the document**: python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <file.docx> <dir> - **Note the suggested RSID**: The unpack script will suggest an RSID to use for your tracked changes. Copy this RSID for use in step 4b. 4. **Implement changes in batches**: Group changes logically (by section, by type, or by proximity) and implement them together in a single script. This approach: - Makes debugging easier (smaller batch = easier to isolate errors) - Allows incremental progress - Maintains efficiency (batch size of 3-10 changes works well) **Suggested batch groupings:** - By document section (e.g., \"Section 3 changes\", \"Definitions\", \"Termination clause\") - By change type (e.g., \"Date changes\", \"Party name updates\", \"Legal term replacements\") - By proximity (e.g., \"Changes on pages 1-3\", \"Changes in first half of document\") For each batch of related changes: **a. Map text to XML**: Grep for text in word/document.xml to verify how text is split across <w:r> elements. **b. Create and run script**: Use get_node to find nodes, implement changes, then doc.save(). See **\"Document Library\"** section in ooxml.md for patterns. **Note**: Always grep word/document.xml immediately before writing a script to get current line numbers and verify text content. Line numbers change after each script run. 5. **Pack the document**: After all batches are complete, convert the unpacked directory back to .docx: 6. **Final verification**: Do a comprehensive check of the complete document: - Convert final document to markdown: - Verify ALL changes were applied correctly: - Check that no unintended changes were introduced ## Converting Documents to Images To visually analyze Word documents, convert them to images using a two-step process: 1. **Convert DOCX to PDF**: 2. **Convert PDF pages to JPEG images**: This creates files like page-1.jpg, page-2.jpg, etc. Options: - -r 150: Sets resolution to 150 DPI (adjust for quality/size balance) - -jpeg: Output JPEG format (use -png for PNG if preferred) - -f N: First page to convert (e.g., -f 2 starts from page 2) - -l N: Last page to convert (e.g., -l 5 stops at page 5) - page: Prefix for output files Example for specific range: ## Code Style Guidelines **IMPORTANT**: When generating code for DOCX operations: - Write concise code - Avoid verbose variable names and redundant operations - Avoid unnecessary print statements ## Dependencies Required dependencies (install if not available): - **pandoc**: sudo apt-get install pandoc (for text extraction) - **docx**: npm install -g docx (for creating new documents) - **LibreOffice**: sudo apt-get install libreoffice (for PDF conversion) - **Poppler**: sudo apt-get install poppler-utils (for pdftoppm to convert PDF to images) - **defusedxml**: pip install defusedxml (for secure XML parsing)", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "docx-official", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\docx-official\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

Your goal is to create email sequences that nurture relationships, drive action, and move people toward conversion. ## Initial Assessment Before creating a sequence, understand: 1. **Sequence Type** - Welcome/onboarding sequence - Lead nurture sequence - Re-engagement sequence - Post-purchase sequence - Event-based sequence - Educational sequence - Sales sequence 2. **Audience Context** - Who are they? - What triggered them into this sequence? - What do they already know/believe? - What's their current relationship with you? 3. **Goals** - Primary conversion goal - Relationship-building goals - Segmentation goals - What defines success? --- ## Core Principles ### 1. One Email, One Job - Each email has one primary purpose - One main CTA per email - Don't try to do everything ### 2. Value Before Ask - Lead with usefulness - Build trust through content - Earn the right to sell ### 3. Relevance Over Volume - Fewer, better emails win - Segment for relevance - Quality > frequency ### 4.

{"id": "skill_formcro_skill", "text": "--- name: form-cro description: When the user wants to optimize any form that is NOT signup/registration \u2014 including lead capture forms, contact forms, demo request forms, application forms, survey forms, or checkout forms. Also use when the user mentions \"form optimization,\" \"lead form conversions,\" \"form friction,\" \"form fields,\" \"form completion rate,\" or \"contact form.\" For signup/registration forms, see signup-flow-cro. For popups containing forms, see popup-cro. --- # Form CRO You are an expert in form optimization. Your goal is to maximize form completion rates while capturing the data that matters. ## Initial Assessment Before providing recommendations, identify: 1. **Form Type** - Lead capture (gated content, newsletter) - Contact form - Demo/sales request - Application form - Survey/feedback - Checkout form - Quote request 2. **Current State** - How many fields? - What's the current completion rate? - Mobile vs. desktop split? - Where do users abandon? 3. **Business Context** - What happens with form submissions? - Which fields are actually used in follow-up? - Are there compliance/legal requirements? --- ## Core Principles ### 1. Every Field Has a Cost Each field reduces completion rate. Rule of thumb: - 3 fields: Baseline - 4-6 fields: 10-25% reduction - 7+ fields: 25-50%+ reduction For each field, ask: - Is this absolutely necessary before we can help them? - Can we get this information another way? - Can we ask this later? ### 2. Value Must Exceed Effort - Clear value proposition above form - Make what they get obvious - Reduce perceived effort (field count, labels) ### 3. Reduce Cognitive Load - One question per field - Clear, conversational labels - Logical grouping and order - Smart defaults where possible --- ## Field-by-Field Optimization ### Email Field - Single field, no confirmation - Inline validation - Typo detection (did you mean gmail.com?) - Proper mobile keyboard ### Name Fields - Single \"Name\" vs. First/Last \u2014 test this - Single field reduces friction - Split needed only if personalization requires it ### Phone Number - Make optional if possible - If required, explain why - Auto-format as they type - Country code handling ### Company/Organization - Auto-suggest for faster entry - Enrichment after submission (Clearbit, etc.) - Consider inferring from email domain ### Job Title/Role - Dropdown if categories matter - Free text if wide variation - Consider making optional ### Message/Comments (Free Text) - Make optional - Reasonable character guidance - Expand on focus ### Dropdown Selects - \"Select one...\" placeholder - Searchable if many options - Consider radio buttons if < 5 options - \"Other\" option with text field ### Checkboxes (Multi-select) - Clear, parallel labels - Reasonable number of options - Consider \"Select all that apply\" instruction --- ## Form Layout Optimization ### Field Order 1. Start with easiest fields (name, email) 2. Build commitment before asking more 3. Sensitive fields last (phone, company size) 4. Logical grouping if many fields ### Labels and Placeholders - Labels: Always visible (not just placeholder) - Placeholders: Examples, not labels - Help text: Only when genuinely helpful **Good:** **Bad:** ### Visual Design - Sufficient spacing between fields - Clear visual hierarchy - CTA button stands out - Mobile-friendly tap targets (44px+) ### Single Column vs. Multi-Column - Single column: Higher completion, mobile-friendly - Multi-column: Only for short related fields (First/Last name) - When in doubt, single column --- ## Multi-Step Forms ### When to Use Multi-Step - More than 5-6 fields - Logically distinct sections - Conditional paths based on answers - Complex forms (applications, quotes) ### Multi-Step Best Practices - Progress indicator (step X of Y) - Start with easy, end with sensitive - One topic per step - Allow back navigation - Save progress (don't lose data on refresh) - Clear indication of required vs. optional ### Progressive Commitment Pattern 1. Low-friction start (just email) 2. More detail (name, company) 3. Qualifying questions 4. Contact preferences --- ## Error Handling ### Inline Validation - Validate as they move to next field - Don't validate too aggressively while typing - Clear visual indicators (green check, red border) ### Error Messages - Specific to the problem - Suggest how to fix - Positioned near the field - Don't clear their input **Good:** \"Please enter a valid email address (e.g., name@company.com)\" **Bad:** \"Invalid input\" ### On Submit - Focus on first error field - Summarize errors if multiple - Preserve all entered data - Don't clear form on error --- ## Submit Button Optimization ### Button Copy Weak: \"Submit\" | \"Send\" Strong: \"[Action] + [What they get]\" Examples: - \"Get My Free Quote\" - \"Download the Guide\" - \"Request Demo\" - \"Send Message\" - \"Start Free Trial\" ### Button Placement - Immediately after last field - Left-aligned with fields - Sufficient size and contrast - Mobile: Sticky or clearly visible ### Post-Submit States - Loading state (disable button, show spinner) - Success confirmation (clear next steps) - Error handling (clear message, focus on issue) --- ## Trust and Friction Reduction ### Near the Form - Privacy statement: \"We'll never share your info\" - Security badges if collecting sensitive data - Testimonial or social proof - Expected response time ### Reducing Perceived Effort - \"Takes 30 seconds\" - Field count indicator - Remove visual clutter - Generous white space ### Addressing Objections - \"No spam, unsubscribe anytime\" - \"We won't share your number\" - \"No credit card required\" --- ## Form Types: Specific Guidance ### Lead Capture (Gated Content) - Minimum viable fields (often just email) - Clear value proposition for what they get - Consider asking enrichment questions post-download - Test email-only vs. email + name ### Contact Form - Essential: Email/Name + Message - Phone optional - Set response time expectations - Offer alternatives (chat, phone) ### Demo Request - Name, Email, Company required - Phone: Optional with \"preferred contact\" choice - Use case/goal question helps personalize - Calendar embed can increase show rate ### Quote/Estimate Request - Multi-step often works well - Start with easy questions - Technical details later - Save progress for complex forms ### Survey Forms - Progress bar essential - One question per screen for engagement - Skip logic for relevance - Consider incentive for completion --- ## Mobile Optimization - Larger touch targets (44px minimum height) - Appropriate keyboard types (email, tel, number) - Autofill support - Single column only - Sticky submit button - Minimal typing (dropdowns, buttons) --- ## Measurement ### Key Metrics - **Form start rate**: Page views \u2192 Started form - **Completion rate**: Started \u2192 Submitted - **Field drop-off**: Which fields lose people - **Error rate**: By field - **Time to complete**: Total and by field - **Mobile vs. desktop**: Completion by device ### What to Track - Form views - First field focus - Each field completion - Errors by field - Submit attempts - Successful submissions --- ## Output Format ### Form Audit For each issue: - **Issue**: What's wrong - **Impact**: Estimated effect on conversions - **Fix**: Specific recommendation - **Priority**: High/Medium/Low ### Recommended Form Design - **Required fields**: Justified list - **Optional fields**: With rationale - **Field order**: Recommended sequence - **Copy**: Labels, placeholders, button - **Error messages**: For each field - **Layout**: Visual guidance ### Test Hypotheses Ideas to A/B test with expected outcomes --- ## Experiment Ideas ### Form Structure Experiments **Layout & Flow** - Single-step form vs. multi-step with progress bar - 1-column vs. 2-column field layout - Form embedded on page vs. separate page - Vertical vs. horizontal field alignment - Form above fold vs. after content **Field Optimization** - Reduce to minimum viable fields - Add or remove phone number field - Add or remove company/organization field - Test required vs. optional field balance - Use field enrichment to auto-fill known data - Hide fields for returning/known visitors **Smart Forms** - Add real-time validation for emails and phone numbers - Progressive profiling (ask more over time) - Conditional fields based on earlier answers - Auto-suggest for company names --- ### Copy & Design Experiments **Labels & Microcopy** - Test field label clarity and length - Placeholder text optimization - Help text: show vs. hide vs. on-hover - Error message tone (friendly vs. direct) **CTAs & Buttons** - Button text variations (\"Submit\" vs. \"Get My Quote\" vs. specific action) - Button color and size testing - Button placement relative to fields **Trust Elements** - Add privacy assurance near form - Show trust badges next to submit - Add testimonial near form - Display expected response time --- ### Form Type-Specific Experiments **Demo Request Forms** - Test with/without phone number requirement - Add \"preferred contact method\" choice - Include \"What's your biggest challenge?\" question - Test calendar embed vs. form submission **Lead Capture Forms** - Email-only vs. email + name - Test value proposition messaging above form - Gated vs. ungated content strategies - Post-submission enrichment questions **Contact Forms** - Add department/topic routing dropdown - Test with/without message field requirement - Show alternative contact methods (chat, phone) - Expected response time messaging --- ### Mobile & UX Experiments - Larger touch targets for mobile - Test appropriate keyboard types by field - Sticky submit button on mobile - Auto-focus first field on page load - Test form container styling (card vs. minimal) --- ## Questions to Ask If you need more context: 1. What's your current form completion rate? 2. Do you have field-level analytics? 3. What happens with the data after submission? 4. Which fields are actually used in follow-up? 5. Are there compliance/legal requirements? 6. What's the mobile vs. desktop split? --- ## Related Skills - **signup-flow-cro**: For account creation forms - **popup-cro**: For forms inside popups/modals - **page-cro**: For the page containing the form - **ab-test-setup**: For testing form changes", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "form-cro", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\form-cro\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

What's the one thing someone will remember? **CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity. Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is: - Production-grade and functional - Visually striking and memorable - Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view - Meticulously refined in every detail ## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines Focus on: - **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font. - **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. - **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise. - **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density. - **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays. NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character. Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations. **IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well. Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "frontend-design", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\frontend-design\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}
{"id": "skill_frontenddevguidelines_skill", "text": "--- name: frontend-dev-guidelines description: Frontend development guidelines for React/TypeScript applications. Modern patterns including Suspense, lazy loading, useSuspenseQuery, file organization with features directory, MUI v7 styling, TanStack Router, performance optimization, and TypeScript best practices. Use when creating components, pages, features, fetching data, styling, routing, or working with frontend code. --- # Frontend Development Guidelines ## Purpose Comprehensive guide for modern React development, emphasizing Suspense-based data fetching, lazy loading, proper file organization, and performance optimization. ## When to Use This Skill - Creating new components or pages - Building new features - Fetching data with TanStack Query - Setting up routing with TanStack Router - Styling components with MUI v7 - Performance optimization - Organizing frontend code - TypeScript best practices --- ## Quick Start ### New Component Checklist Creating a component? Follow this checklist: - [ ] Use React.FC<Props> pattern with TypeScript - [ ] Lazy load if heavy component: React.lazy(() => import()) - [ ] Wrap in <SuspenseLoader> for loading states - [ ] Use useSuspenseQuery for data fetching - [ ] Import aliases: @/, ~types, ~components, ~features - [ ] Styles: Inline if <100 lines, separate file if >100 lines - [ ] Use useCallback for event handlers passed to children - [ ] Default export at bottom - [ ] No early returns with loading spinners - [ ] Use useMuiSnackbar for user notifications ### New Feature Checklist Creating a feature? Set up this structure: - [ ] Create features/{feature-name}/ directory - [ ] Create subdirectories: api/, components/, hooks/, helpers/, types/ - [ ] Create API service file: api/{feature}Api.ts - [ ] Set up TypeScript types in types/ - [ ] Create route in routes/{feature-name}/index.tsx - [ ] Lazy load feature components - [ ] Use Suspense boundaries - [ ] Export public API from feature index.ts --- ## Import Aliases Quick Reference | Alias | Resolves To | Example | |-------|-------------|---------| | @/ | src/ | import { apiClient } from '@/lib/apiClient' | | ~types | src/types | import type { User } from '~types/user' | | ~components | src/components | import { SuspenseLoader } from '~components/SuspenseLoader' | | ~features | src/features | import { authApi } from '~features/auth' | Defined in: [vite.config.ts](../../vite.config.ts) lines 180-185 --- ## Common Imports Cheatsheet --- ## Topic Guides ### \ud83c\udfa8 Component Patterns **Modern React components use:** - React.FC<Props> for type safety - React.lazy() for code splitting - SuspenseLoader for loading states - Named const + default export pattern **Key Concepts:** - Lazy load heavy components (DataGrid, charts, editors) - Always wrap lazy components in Suspense - Use SuspenseLoader component (with fade animation) - Component structure: Props \u2192 Hooks \u2192 Handlers \u2192 Render \u2192 Export **[\ud83d\udcd6 Complete Guide: resources/component-patterns.md](resources/component-patterns.md)** --- ### \ud83d\udcca Data Fetching **PRIMARY PATTERN: useSuspenseQuery** - Use with Suspense boundaries - Cache-first strategy (check grid cache before API) - Replaces isLoading checks - Type-safe with generics **API Service Layer:** - Create features/{feature}/api/{feature}Api.ts - Use apiClient axios instance - Centralized methods per feature - Route format: /form/route (NOT /api/form/route) **[\ud83d\udcd6 Complete Guide: resources/data-fetching.md](resources/data-fetching.md)** --- ### \ud83d\udcc1 File Organization **features/ vs components/:** - features/: Domain-specific (posts, comments, auth) - components/: Truly reusable (SuspenseLoader, CustomAppBar) **Feature Subdirectories:** **[\ud83d\udcd6 Complete Guide: resources/file-organization.md](resources/file-organization.md)** --- ### \ud83c\udfa8 Styling **Inline vs Separate:** - <100 lines: Inline const styles: Record<string, SxProps<Theme>> - >100 lines: Separate .styles.ts file **Primary Method:** - Use sx prop for MUI components - Type-safe with SxProps<Theme> - Theme access: (theme) => theme.palette.primary.main **MUI v7 Grid:** **[\ud83d\udcd6 Complete Guide: resources/styling-guide.md](resources/styling-guide.md)** --- ### \ud83d\udee3\ufe0f Routing **TanStack Router - Folder-Based:** - Directory: routes/my-route/index.tsx - Lazy load components - Use createFileRoute - Breadcrumb data in loader **Example:** **[\ud83d\udcd6 Complete Guide: resources/routing-guide.md](resources/routing-guide.md)** --- ### \u23f3 Loading & Error States **CRITICAL RULE: No Early Returns** **Why:** Prevents Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), better UX **Error Handling:** - Use useMuiSnackbar for user feedback - NEVER react-toastify - TanStack Query onError callbacks **[\ud83d\udcd6 Complete Guide: resources/loading-and-error-states.md](resources/loading-and-error-states.md)** --- ### \u26a1 Performance **Optimization Patterns:** - useMemo: Expensive computations (filter, sort, map) - useCallback: Event handlers passed to children - React.memo: Expensive components - Debounced search (300-500ms) - Memory leak prevention (cleanup in useEffect) **[\ud83d\udcd6 Complete Guide: resources/performance.md](resources/performance.md)** --- ### \ud83d\udcd8 TypeScript **Standards:** - Strict mode, no any type - Explicit return types on functions - Type imports: import type { User } from '~types/user' - Component prop interfaces with JSDoc **[\ud83d\udcd6 Complete Guide: resources/typescript-standards.md](resources/typescript-standards.md)** --- ### \ud83d\udd27 Common Patterns **Covered Topics:** - React Hook Form with Zod validation - DataGrid wrapper contracts - Dialog component standards - useAuth hook for current user - Mutation patterns with cache invalidation **[\ud83d\udcd6 Complete Guide: resources/common-patterns.md](resources/common-patterns.md)** --- ### \ud83d\udcda Complete Examples **Full working examples:** -

This skill teaches the PRINCIPLES of game development and directs you to the right sub-skill based on context. --- ## Sub-Skill Routing ### Platform Selection | If the game targets... | Use Sub-Skill | |------------------------|---------------| | Web browsers (HTML5, WebGL) | game-development/web-games | | Mobile (iOS, Android) | game-development/mobile-games | | PC (Steam, Desktop) | game-development/pc-games | | VR/AR headsets | game-development/vr-ar | ### Dimension Selection | If the game is... | Use Sub-Skill | |-------------------|---------------| | 2D (sprites, tilemaps) | game-development/2d-games | | 3D (meshes, shaders) | game-development/3d-games | ### Specialty Areas | If you need... | Use Sub-Skill | |----------------|---------------| | GDD, balancing, player psychology | game-development/game-design | | Multiplayer, networking | game-development/multiplayer | | Visual style, asset pipeline, animation | game-development/game-art | | Sound design, music, adaptive audio | game-development/game-audio | --- ## Core Principles (All Platforms) ### 1. The Game Loop Every game, regardless of platform, follows this pattern: **Fixed Timestep Rule:** - Physics/logic: Fixed rate (e.g., 50Hz) - Rendering: As fast as possible - Interpolate between states for smooth visuals --- ### 2. Pattern Selection Matrix | Pattern | Use When | Example | |---------|----------|---------| | **State Machine** | 3-5 discrete states | Player: Idle\u2192Walk\u2192Jump | | **Object Pooling** | Frequent spawn/destroy | Bullets, particles | | **Observer/Events** | Cross-system communication | Health\u2192UI updates | | **ECS** | Thousands of similar entities | RTS units, particles | | **Command** | Undo, replay, networking | Input recording | | **Behavior Tree** | Complex AI decisions | Enemy AI | **Decision Rule:** Start with State Machine.

This skill covers both database object references and static file references, detection techniques using parameter manipulation and enumeration, exploitation via Burp Suite, and remediation strategies for securing applications against unauthorized access. ## Inputs / Prerequisites - **Target Web Application**: URL of application with user-specific resources - **Multiple User Accounts**: At least two test accounts to verify cross-user access - **Burp Suite or Proxy Tool**: Intercepting proxy for request manipulation - **Authorization**: Written permission for security testing - **Understanding of Application Flow**: Knowledge of how objects are referenced (IDs, filenames) ## Outputs / Deliverables - **IDOR Vulnerability Report**: Documentation of discovered access control bypasses - **Proof of Concept**: Evidence of unauthorized data access across user contexts - **Affected Endpoints**: List of vulnerable API endpoints and parameters - **Impact Assessment**: Classification of data exposure severity - **Remediation Recommendations**: Specific fixes for identified vulnerabilities ## Core Workflow ### 1. Understand IDOR Vulnerability Types #### Direct Reference to Database Objects Occurs when applications reference database records via user-controllable parameters: #### Direct Reference to Static Files Occurs when applications expose file paths or names that can be enumerated: ### 2. Reconnaissance and Setup #### Create Multiple Test Accounts #### Identify Object References Capture and analyze requests containing: - Numeric IDs in URLs: /api/user/123 - Numeric IDs in parameters: ?id=123&action=view - Numeric IDs in request body: {\"userId\": 123} - File paths: /download/receipt_123.pdf - GUIDs/UUIDs: /profile/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-... #### Map User IDs ### 3.

They're also for people with some, but not a lot of context on what the team does. 3Ps can cover a team of any size, ranging all the way up to the entire company. The bigger the team, the less granular the tasks should be. For example, \"mobile team\" might have \"shipped feature\" or \"fixed bugs,\" whereas the company might have really meaty 3Ps, like \"hired 20 new people\" or \"closed 10 new deals.\" They represent the work of the team across a time period, almost always one week. They include three sections: 1) Progress: what the team has accomplished over the next time period. Focus mainly on things shipped, milestones achieved, tasks created, etc. 2) Plans: what the team plans to do over the next time period. Focus on what things are top-of-mind, really high priority, etc. for the team. 3) Problems: anything that is slowing the team down. This could be things like too few people, bugs or blockers that are preventing the team from moving forward, some deal that fell through, etc. Before writing them, make sure that you know the team name. If it's not specified, you can ask explicitly what the team name you're writing for is. ## Tools Available Whenever possible, try to pull from available sources to get the information you need: - Slack: posts from team members with their updates - ideally look for posts in large channels with lots of reactions - Google Drive: docs written from critical team members with lots of views - Email: emails with lots of responses of lots of content that seems relevant - Calendar: non-recurring meetings that have a lot of importance, like product reviews, etc. Try to gather as much context as you can, focusing on the things that covered the time period you're writing for: - Progress: anything between a week ago and today - Plans: anything from today to the next week - Problems: anything between a week ago and today If you don't have access, you can ask the user for things they want to cover. They might also include these things to you directly, in which case you're mostly just formatting for this particular format. ## Workflow 1. **Clarify scope**: Confirm the team name and time period (usually past week for Progress/Problems, next week for Plans) 2. **Gather information**: Use available tools or ask the user directly 3. **Draft the update**: Follow the strict formatting guidelines 4. **Review**: Ensure it's concise (30-60 seconds to read) and data-driven ## Formatting The format is always the same, very strict formatting. Never use any formatting other than this. Pick an emoji that is fun and captures the vibe of the team and update. [pick an emoji] [Team Name] (Dates Covered, usually a week) Progress: [1-3 sentences of content] Plans: [1-3 sentences of content] Problems: [1-3 sentences of content] Each section should be no more than 1-3 sentences: clear, to the point. It should be data-driven, and generally include metrics where possible.

{"id": "skill_examples_companynewsletter", "text": "## Instructions You are being asked to write a company-wide newsletter update. You are meant to summarize the past week/month of a company in the form of a newsletter that the entire company will read. It should be maybe ~20-25 bullet points long. It will be sent via Slack and email, so make it consumable for that. Ideally it includes the following attributes: - Lots of links: pulling documents from Google Drive that are very relevant, linking to prominent Slack messages in announce channels and from executives, perhgaps referencing emails that went company-wide, highlighting significant things that have happened in the company. - Short and to-the-point: each bullet should probably be no longer than ~1-2 sentences - Use the \"we\" tense, as you are part of the company. Many of the bullets should say \"we did this\" or \"we did that\" ## Tools to use If you have access to the following tools, please try to use them. If not, you can also let the user know directly that their responses would be better if they gave them access. - Slack: look for messages in channels with lots of people, with lots of reactions or lots of responses within the thread - Email: look for things from executives that discuss company-wide announcements - Calendar: if there were meetings with large attendee lists, particularly things like All-Hands meetings, big company announcements, etc. If there were documents attached to those meetings, those are great links to include. - Documents: if there were new docs published in the last week or two that got a lot of attention, you can link them. These should be things like company-wide vision docs, plans for the upcoming quarter or half, things authored by critical executives, etc. - External press: if you see references to articles or press we've received over the past week, that could be really cool too. If you don't have access to any of these things, you can ask the user for things they want to cover. In this case, you'll mostly just be polishing up and fitting to this format more directly. ## Sections The company is pretty big: 1000+ people. There are a variety of different teams and initiatives going on across the company. To make sure the update works well, try breaking it into sections of similar things. You might break into clusters like {product development, go to market, finance} or {recruiting, execution, vision}, or {external news, internal news} etc. Try to make sure the different areas of the company are highlighted well. ## Prioritization Focus on: - Company-wide impact (not team-specific details) - Announcements from leadership - Major milestones and achievements - Information that affects most employees - External recognition or press Avoid: - Overly granular team updates (save those for 3Ps) - Information only relevant to small groups - Duplicate information already communicated ## Example Formats :megaphone: Company Announcements - Announcement 1 - Announcement 2 - Announcement 3 :dart: Progress on Priorities - Area 1 - Sub-area 1 - Sub-area 2 - Sub-area 3 - Area 2 - Sub-area 1 - Sub-area 2 - Sub-area 3 - Area 3 - Sub-area 1 - Sub-area 2 - Sub-area 3 :pillar: Leadership Updates - Post 1 - Post 2 - Post 3 :thread: Social Updates - Update 1 - Update 2 - Update 3", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "examples", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\internal-comms-anthropic\\examples\\company-newsletter.md", "title": "company-newsletter"}}

Every week, there are lots of questions that get asked across the company, and your goal is to try to summarize what those questions are. We want our company to be well-informed and on the same page, so your job is to produce a set of frequently asked questions that our employees are asking and attempt to answer them. Your singular job is to do two things: - Find questions that are big sources of confusion for lots of employees at the company, generally about things that affect a large portion of the employee base - Attempt to give a nice summarized answer to that question in order to minimize confusion. Some examples of areas that may be interesting to folks: recent corporate events (fundraising, new executives, etc.), upcoming launches, hiring progress, changes to vision or focus, etc. ## Tools Available You should use the company's available tools, where communication and work happens. For most companies, it looks something like this: - Slack: questions being asked across the company - it could be questions in response to posts with lots of responses, questions being asked with lots of reactions or thumbs up to show support, or anything else to show that a large number of employees want to ask the same things - Email: emails with FAQs written directly in them can be a good source as well - Documents: docs in places like Google Drive, linked on calendar events, etc. can also be a good source of FAQs, either directly added or inferred based on the contents of the doc ## Formatting The formatting should be pretty basic: - *Question*: [insert question - 1 sentence] - *Answer*: [insert answer - 1-2 sentence] ## Guidance Make sure you're being holistic in your questions. Don't focus too much on just the user in question or the team they are a part of, but try to capture the entire company. Try to be as holistic as you can in reading all the tools available, producing responses that are relevant to all at the company. ## Answer Guidelines - Base answers on official company communications when possible - If information is uncertain, indicate that clearly - Link to authoritative sources (docs, announcements, emails) - Keep tone professional but approachable - Flag if a question requires executive input or official response", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "examples", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\internal-comms-anthropic\\examples\\faq-answers.md", "title": "faq-answers"}}

{"id": "skill_kaizen_skill", "text": "--- name: kaizen description: Guide for continuous improvement, error proofing, and standardization. Use this skill when the user wants to improve code quality, refactor, or discuss process improvements. --- # Kaizen: Continuous Improvement ## Overview Small improvements, continuously. Error-proof by design. Follow what works. Build only what's needed. **Core principle:** Many small improvements beat one big change. Prevent errors at design time, not with fixes. ## When to Use **Always applied for:** - Code implementation and refactoring - Architecture and design decisions - Process and workflow improvements - Error handling and validation **Philosophy:** Quality through incremental progress and prevention, not perfection through massive effort. ## The Four Pillars ### 1. Continuous Improvement (Kaizen) Small, frequent improvements compound into major gains. #### Principles **Incremental over revolutionary:** - Make smallest viable change that improves quality - One improvement at a time - Verify each change before next - Build momentum through small wins **Always leave code better:** - Fix small issues as you encounter them - Refactor while you work (within scope) - Update outdated comments - Remove dead code when you see it **Iterative refinement:** - First version: make it work - Second pass: make it clear - Third pass: make it efficient - Don't try all three at once <Good> Each step is complete, tested, and working </Good> <Bad> Overwhelming, error-prone, hard to verify </Bad> #### In Practice **When implementing features:** 1. Start with simplest version that works 2. Add one improvement (error handling, validation, etc.) 3. Test and verify 4. Repeat if time permits 5. Don't try to make it perfect immediately **When refactoring:** - Fix one smell at a time - Commit after each improvement - Keep tests passing throughout - Stop when \"good enough\" (diminishing returns) **When reviewing code:** - Suggest incremental improvements (not rewrites) - Prioritize: critical \u2192 important \u2192 nice-to-have - Focus on highest-impact changes first - Accept \"better than before\" even if not perfect ### 2. Poka-Yoke (Error Proofing) Design systems that prevent errors at compile/design time, not runtime. #### Principles **Make errors impossible:** - Type system catches mistakes - Compiler enforces contracts - Invalid states unrepresentable - Errors caught early (left of production) **Design for safety:** - Fail fast and loudly - Provide helpful error messages - Make correct path obvious - Make incorrect path difficult **Defense in layers:** 1. Type system (compile time) 2. Validation (runtime, early) 3. Guards (preconditions) 4. Error boundaries (graceful degradation) #### Type System Error Proofing <Good> Type system prevents entire classes of errors </Good> <Good> Function signature guarantees safety </Good> #### Validation Error Proofing <Good> Validate once at boundary, safe everywhere else </Good> #### Guards and Preconditions <Good> Guards make assumptions explicit and enforced </Good> #### Configuration Error Proofing <Good> Fail at startup, not in production </Good> #### In Practice **When designing APIs:** - Use types to constrain inputs - Make invalid states unrepresentable - Return Result<T, E> instead of throwing - Document preconditions in types **When handling errors:** - Validate at system boundaries - Use guards for preconditions - Fail fast with clear messages - Log context for debugging **When configuring:** - Required over optional with defaults - Validate all config at startup - Fail deployment if config invalid - Don't allow partial configurations ### 3. Standardized Work Follow established patterns. Document what works. Make good practices easy to follow. #### Principles **Consistency over cleverness:** - Follow existing codebase patterns - Don't reinvent solved problems - New pattern only if significantly better - Team agreement on new patterns **Documentation lives with code:** - README for setup and architecture - CLAUDE.md for AI coding conventions - Comments for \"why\", not \"what\" - Examples for complex patterns **Automate standards:** - Linters enforce style - Type checks enforce contracts - Tests verify behavior - CI/CD enforces quality gates #### Following Patterns <Good> Consistency makes codebase predictable </Good> <Bad> Inconsistency creates confusion </Bad> #### Error Handling Patterns <Good> Standard pattern across codebase </Good> #### Documentation Standards <Good> Documents why, when, and how </Good> #### In Practice **Before adding new patterns:** - Search codebase for similar problems solved - Check CLAUDE.md for project conventions - Discuss with team if breaking from pattern - Update docs when introducing new pattern **When writing code:** - Match existing file structure - Use same naming conventions - Follow same error handling approach - Import from same locations **When reviewing:** - Check consistency with existing code - Point to examples in codebase - Suggest aligning with standards - Update CLAUDE.md if new standard emerges ### 4. Just-In-Time (JIT) Build what's needed now. No more, no less. Avoid premature optimization and over-engineering. #### Principles **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):** - Implement only current requirements - No \"just in case\" features - No \"we might need this later\" code - Delete speculation **Simplest thing that works:** - Start with straightforward solution - Add complexity only when needed - Refactor when requirements change - Don't anticipate future needs **Optimize when measured:** - No premature optimization - Profile before optimizing - Measure impact of changes - Accept \"good enough\" performance #### YAGNI in Action <Good> Simple, meets current need </Good> <Bad> Building for imaginary future requirements </Bad> **When to add complexity:** - Current requirement demands it - Pain points identified through use - Measured performance issues - Multiple use cases emerged <Good> Complexity added only when needed </Good> #### Premature Abstraction <Bad> Massive abstraction for uncertain future </Bad> <Good> Abstract only when pattern proven across 3+ cases </Good> #### Performance Optimization <Good> Optimize based on measurement, not assumptions </Good> <Bad> Complex solution for unmeasured problem </Bad> #### In Practice **When implementing:** - Solve the immediate problem - Use straightforward approach - Resist \"what if\" thinking - Delete speculative code **When optimizing:** - Profile first, optimize second - Measure before and after - Document why optimization needed - Keep simple version in tests **When abstracting:** - Wait for 3+ similar cases (Rule of Three) - Make abstraction as simple as possible - Prefer duplication over wrong abstraction - Refactor when pattern clear ## Integration with Commands The Kaizen skill guides how you work. The commands provide structured analysis: - **/why**: Root cause analysis (5 Whys) - **/cause-and-effect**: Multi-factor analysis (Fishbone) - **/plan-do-check-act**: Iterative improvement cycles - **/analyse-problem**: Comprehensive documentation (A3) - **/analyse**: Smart method selection (Gemba/VSM/Muda) Use commands for structured problem-solving. Apply skill for day-to-day development. ## Red Flags **Violating Continuous Improvement:** - \"I'll refactor it later\" (never happens) - Leaving code worse than you found it - Big bang rewrites instead of incremental **Violating Poka-Yoke:** - \"Users should just be careful\" - Validation after use instead of before - Optional config with no validation **Violating Standardized Work:** - \"I prefer to do it my way\" - Not checking existing patterns - Ignoring project conventions **Violating Just-In-Time:** - \"We might need this someday\" - Building frameworks before using them - Optimizing without measuring ## Remember **Kaizen is about:** - Small improvements continuously - Preventing errors by design - Following proven patterns - Building only what's needed **Not about:** - Perfection on first try - Massive refactoring projects - Clever abstractions - Premature optimization **Mindset:** Good enough today, better tomorrow.

Also use when the user mentions 'launch,' 'Product Hunt,' 'feature release,' 'announcement,' 'go-to-market,' 'beta launch,' 'early access,' 'waitlist,' or 'product update.' This skill covers phased launches, channel strategy, and ongoing launch momentum.\" --- # Launch Strategy You are an expert in SaaS product launches and feature announcements. Your goal is to help users plan launches that build momentum, capture attention, and convert interest into users. ## Core Philosophy The best companies don't just launch once\u2014they launch again and again. Every new feature, improvement, and update is an opportunity to capture attention and engage your audience. A strong launch isn't about a single moment. It's about: - Getting your product into users' hands early - Learning from real feedback - Making a splash at every stage - Building momentum that compounds over time --- ## The ORB Framework Structure your launch marketing across three channel types. Everything should ultimately lead back to owned channels. ### Owned Channels You own the channel (though not the audience). Direct access without algorithms or platform rules. **Examples:** - Email list - Blog - Podcast - Branded community (Slack, Discord) - Website/product **Why they matter:** - Get more effective over time - No algorithm changes or pay-to-play - Direct relationship with audience - Compound value from content **Start with 1-2 based on audience:** - Industry lacks quality content \u2192 Start a blog - People want direct updates \u2192 Focus on email - Engagement matters \u2192 Build a community **Example - Superhuman:** Built demand through an invite-only waitlist and one-on-one onboarding sessions. Every new user got a 30-minute live demo. This created exclusivity, FOMO, and word-of-mouth\u2014all through owned relationships. Years later, their original onboarding materials still drive engagement. ### Rented Channels Platforms that provide visibility but you don't control. Algorithms shift, rules change, pay-to-play increases. **Examples:** - Social media (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram) - App stores and marketplaces - YouTube - Reddit **How to use correctly:** - Pick 1-2 platforms where your audience is active - Use them to drive traffic to owned channels - Don't rely on them as your only strategy **Example - Notion:** Hacked virality through Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit where productivity enthusiasts were active. Encouraged community to share templates and workflows. But they funneled all visibility into owned assets\u2014every viral post led to signups, then targeted email onboarding. **Platform-specific tactics:** - Twitter/X: Threads that spark conversation \u2192 link to newsletter - LinkedIn: High-value posts \u2192 lead to gated content or email signup - Marketplaces (Shopify, Slack): Optimize listing \u2192 drive to site for more Rented channels give speed, not stability. Capture momentum by bringing users into your owned ecosystem. ### Borrowed Channels Tap into someone else's audience to shortcut the hardest part\u2014getting noticed. **Examples:** - Guest content (blog posts, podcast interviews, newsletter features) - Collaborations (webinars, co-marketing, social takeovers) - Speaking engagements (conferences, panels, virtual summits) - Influencer partnerships **Be proactive, not passive:** 1. List industry leaders your audience follows 2. Pitch win-win collaborations 3. Use tools like SparkToro or Listen Notes to find audience overlap 4. Set up affiliate/referral incentives **Example - TRMNL:** Sent a free e-ink display to YouTuber Snazzy Labs\u2014not a paid sponsorship, just hoping he'd like it. He created an in-depth review that racked up 500K+ views and drove $500K+ in sales. They also set up an affiliate program for ongoing promotion. Borrowed channels give instant credibility, but only work if you convert borrowed attention into owned relationships. --- ## Five-Phase Launch Approach Launching isn't a one-day event. It's a phased process that builds momentum. ### Phase 1: Internal Launch Gather initial feedback and iron out major issues before going public. **Actions:** - Recruit early users one-on-one to test for free - Collect feedback on usability gaps and missing features - Ensure prototype is functional enough to demo (doesn't need to be production-ready) **Goal:** Validate core functionality with friendly users. ### Phase 2: Alpha Launch Put the product in front of external users in a controlled way. **Actions:** - Create landing page with early access signup form - Announce the product exists - Invite users individually to start testing - MVP should be working in production (even if still evolving) **Goal:** First external validation and initial waitlist building. ### Phase 3: Beta Launch Scale up early access while generating external buzz. **Actions:** - Work through early access list (some free, some paid) - Start marketing with teasers about problems you solve - Recruit friends, investors, and influencers to test and share **Consider adding:** - Coming soon landing page or waitlist - \"Beta\" sticker in dashboard navigation - Email invites to early access list - Early access toggle in settings for experimental features **Goal:** Build buzz and refine product with broader feedback. ### Phase 4: Early Access Launch Shift from small-scale testing to controlled expansion. **Actions:** - Leak product details: screenshots, feature GIFs, demos - Gather quantitative usage data and qualitative feedback - Run user research with engaged users (incentivize with credits) - Optionally run product/market fit survey to refine messaging **Expansion options:** - Option A: Throttle invites in batches (5-10% at a time) - Option B: Invite all users at once under \"early access\" framing **Goal:** Validate at scale and prepare for full launch. ### Phase 5: Full Launch Open the floodgates. **Actions:** - Open self-serve signups - Start charging (if not already) - Announce general availability across all channels **Launch touchpoints:** - Customer emails - In-app popups and product tours - Website banner linking to launch assets - \"New\" sticker in dashboard navigation - Blog post announcement - Social posts across platforms - Product Hunt, BetaList, Hacker News, etc. **Goal:** Maximum visibility and conversion to paying users. --- ## Product Hunt Launch Strategy Product Hunt can be powerful for reaching early adopters, but it's not magic\u2014it requires preparation. ### Pros - Exposure to tech-savvy early adopter audience - Credibility bump (especially if Product of the Day) - Potential PR coverage and backlinks ### Cons - Very competitive to rank well - Short-lived traffic spikes - Requires significant pre-launch planning ### How to Launch Successfully **Before launch day:** 1. Build relationships with influential supporters, content hubs, and communities 2. Optimize your listing: compelling tagline, polished visuals, short demo video 3. Study successful launches to identify what worked 4. Engage in relevant communities\u2014provide value before pitching 5. Prepare your team for all-day engagement **On launch day:** 1. Treat it as an all-day event 2. Respond to every comment in real-time 3. Answer questions and spark discussions 4. Encourage your existing audience to engage 5. Direct traffic back to your site to capture signups **After launch day:** 1. Follow up with everyone who engaged 2. Convert Product Hunt traffic into owned relationships (email signups) 3. Continue momentum with post-launch content ### Case Studies **SavvyCal** (Scheduling tool): - Optimized landing page and onboarding before launch - Built relationships with productivity/SaaS influencers in advance - Responded to every comment on launch day - Result: #2 Product of the Month **Reform** (Form builder): - Studied successful launches and applied insights - Crafted clear tagline, polished visuals, demo video - Engaged in communities before launch (provided value first) - Treated launch as all-day engagement event - Directed traffic to capture signups - Result: #1 Product of the Day --- ## Post-Launch Product Marketing Your launch isn't over when the announcement goes live. Now comes adoption and retention work. ### Immediate Post-Launch Actions **Educate new users:** Set up automated onboarding email sequence introducing key features and use cases. **Reinforce the launch:** Include announcement in your weekly/biweekly/monthly roundup email to catch people who missed it. **Differentiate against competitors:** Publish comparison pages highlighting why you're the obvious choice. **Update web pages:** Add dedicated sections about the new feature/product across your site. **Offer hands-on preview:** Create no-code interactive demo (using tools like Navattic) so visitors can explore before signing up. ### Keep Momentum Going It's easier to build on existing momentum than start from scratch. Every touchpoint reinforces the launch. --- ## Ongoing Launch Strategy Don't rely on a single launch event. Regular updates and feature rollouts sustain engagement. ### How to Prioritize What to Announce Use this matrix to decide how much marketing each update deserves: **Major updates** (new features, product overhauls): - Full campaign across multiple channels - Blog post, email campaign, in-app messages, social media - Maximize exposure **Medium updates** (new integrations, UI enhancements): - Targeted announcement - Email to relevant segments, in-app banner - Don't need full fanfare **Minor updates** (bug fixes, small tweaks): - Changelog and release notes - Signal that product is improving - Don't dominate marketing ### Announcement Tactics **Space out releases:** Instead of shipping everything at once, stagger announcements to maintain momentum. **Reuse high-performing tactics:** If a previous announcement resonated, apply those insights to future updates. **Keep engaging:** Continue using email, social, and in-app messaging to highlight improvements. **Signal active development:** Even small changelog updates remind customers your product is evolving. This builds retention and word-of-mouth\u2014customers feel confident you'll be around. --- ## Launch Checklist ### Pre-Launch - [ ] Landing page with clear value proposition - [ ] Email capture / waitlist signup - [ ] Early access list built - [ ] Owned channels established (email, blog, community) - [ ] Rented channel presence (social profiles optimized) - [ ] Borrowed channel opportunities identified (podcasts, influencers) - [ ] Product Hunt listing prepared (if using) - [ ] Launch assets created (screenshots, demo video, GIFs) - [ ] Onboarding flow ready - [ ] Analytics/tracking in place ### Launch Day - [ ] Announcement email to list - [ ] Blog post published - [ ] Social posts scheduled and posted - [ ] Product Hunt listing live (if using) - [ ] In-app announcement for existing users - [ ] Website banner/notification active - [ ] Team ready to engage and respond - [ ] Monitor for issues and feedback ### Post-Launch - [ ] Onboarding email sequence active - [ ] Follow-up with engaged prospects - [ ] Roundup email includes announcement - [ ] Comparison pages published - [ ] Interactive demo created - [ ] Gather and act on feedback - [ ] Plan next launch moment --- ## Questions to Ask If you need more context: 1.

Enterprise Security Features (run.sh:70-76, 923-983) - **Staged Autonomy Mode** (LOKI_STAGED_AUTONOMY=true) - Creates execution plan in .loki/plans/current-plan.md - Waits for .loki/signals/PLAN_APPROVED before proceeding - Mirrors Cursor's staged autonomy pattern - **Audit Logging** (LOKI_AUDIT_LOG=true) - JSONL audit trail at .loki/logs/audit-YYYYMMDD.jsonl - Logs: timestamp, event type, data, user, PID - Events: SESSION_START, SESSION_END, AGENT_SPAWN, TASK_COMPLETE - **Command Blocking** (LOKI_BLOCKED_COMMANDS) - Default blocks: rm -rf /, dd if=, mkfs, fork bomb - Customizable via environment variable - **Parallel Agent Limiting** (LOKI_MAX_PARALLEL_AGENTS=10) - Prevents resource exhaustion from too many agents - Enforced in RARV instruction - **Path Restrictions** (LOKI_ALLOWED_PATHS) - Restrict agent access to specific directories - Empty = all paths allowed (default) #### 3. Cross-Project Learnings Database (run.sh:986-1136) - **Global Learnings Directory** (~/.loki/learnings/) - patterns.jsonl - Successful patterns from past projects - mistakes.jsonl - Errors to avoid with prevention strategies - successes.jsonl - Proven approaches that worked - **Automatic Learning Extraction** - Parses CONTINUITY.md \"Mistakes & Learnings\" section at session end - **Contextual Loading** - Loads relevant learnings based on PRD content at session start - **Relevant Learnings File** - .loki/state/relevant-learnings.json for agent access - **Addresses Gap** - Competitors like Claude-Flow have AgentDB; now Loki Mode has cross-project memory #### 4. Competitive Analysis Documentation (docs/COMPETITIVE-ANALYSIS.md) - **Factual Comparison Table** - Real metrics vs competitors - GitHub stars, agent counts, benchmark scores - Enterprise security, observability, pricing - Production readiness assessment - **Detailed Competitor Analysis** - Claude-Flow, MetaGPT, CrewAI, Cursor, Devin - **Critical Gaps Identified** - 5 priority areas for improvement - **Loki Mode Advantages** - Business ops, full SDLC, RARV, resource monitoring - **Improvement Roadmap** - Phased plan for addressing gaps ### Changed - **RARV Cycle** - Enhanced to check cross-project learnings (run.sh:1430) - Reads .loki/state/relevant-learnings.json at REASON step - Avoids known mistakes from previous projects - Applies successful patterns automatically - **Main Function** - Initializes learnings DB and extracts learnings at session end ### Impact - **Credibility** - Benchmark infrastructure for verifiable claims - **Enterprise Ready** - Security features required for adoption - **Learning System** - Agents improve across projects, not just within sessions - **Competitive Positioning** - Clear documentation of advantages and gaps ### Competitive Position After This Release | Capability | Before | After | |------------|--------|-------| | Published Benchmarks | None | HumanEval + SWE-bench infrastructure | | Enterprise Security | --dangerously-skip-permissions | Staged autonomy, audit logs, command blocking | | Cross-Project Learning | None | Global learnings database | | Competitive Documentation | None | Detailed analysis with sources | ## [2.18.5] - 2026-01-04 ### Added - **System Resource Monitoring** - Prevents computer overload from too many parallel agents (run.sh:786-899): - **Background Resource Monitor** checks CPU and memory usage every 5 minutes (configurable) - **Automatic Warnings** logged when CPU or memory exceeds thresholds (default: 80%) - **Resources JSON File** (.loki/state/resources.json) contains real-time resource status - **RARV Integration** - Claude checks resources.json during REASON step and throttles agents if needed - **macOS & Linux Support** - Platform-specific CPU/memory detection using top, vm_stat, free - **Configurable Thresholds** via environment variables: - LOKI_RESOURCE_CHECK_INTERVAL (default: 300 seconds = 5 minutes) - LOKI_RESOURCE_CPU_THRESHOLD (default: 80%) - LOKI_RESOURCE_MEM_THRESHOLD (default: 80%) ### Changed - **RARV Cycle** - Updated REASON step to check .loki/state/resources.json for warnings (run.sh:1194) - If CPU or memory is high, Claude will reduce parallel agent spawning or pause non-critical tasks - Prevents system from becoming unusable due to too many agents - **Cleanup Handlers** - stop_status_monitor() now also stops resource monitor (run.sh:335) ### Why This Matters **User Problem:** \"Loki Mode spinning agents made my computer unusable and I had to hard restart\" **Solution:** Resource monitoring prevents this by: 1. Continuously tracking CPU and memory usage every 5 minutes 2. Warning when thresholds are exceeded 3. Allowing Claude to self-throttle by reducing agent count 4. User can configure thresholds based on their hardware ### Impact - **Prevents System Overload:** No more hard restarts due to too many parallel agents - **Self-Regulating:** Claude automatically reduces agent spawning when resources are constrained - **Transparent:** Resource status visible in .loki/state/resources.json - **Configurable:** Users can set custom thresholds for their hardware - **Cross-Platform:** Works on macOS and Linux - **User Request:** Directly addresses \"add capability to check cpu and memory every few mins and let claude take decision on it\" ## [2.18.4] - 2026-01-04 ### Changed - **README.md Complete Restructure** - Transformed README to focus on value proposition and user experience: - **New Hero Section:** Clear tagline \"The First Truly Autonomous Multi-Agent Startup System\" with compelling value prop - **\"Why Loki Mode?\" Section:** Direct comparison table showing what others do vs. what Loki Mode does - **Core Advantages List:** 5 key differentiators (truly autonomous, massively parallel, production-ready, self-improving, zero babysitting) - **Dashboard & Real-Time Monitoring Section:** Dedicated section showcasing agent monitoring and task queue visualization with screenshot placeholders - **Autonomous Capabilities Section:** Prominent explanation of RARV cycle, perpetual improvement mode, and auto-resume/self-healing - **Simplified Quick Start:** 5-step getting started guide with clear \"walk away\" messaging - **Cleaner Installation:** Moved detailed installation steps to separate INSTALLATION.md - **Better Structure:** Logical flow from \"what it is\" \u2192 \"why it's better\" \u2192 \"how to use it\" \u2192 \"how it works\" ### Added - **INSTALLATION.md** - Comprehensive installation guide with all platforms: - Table of contents for easy navigation - Quick install section (recommended approach) - Three installation options for Claude Code (git clone, releases, minimal curl) - Claude.ai web installation instructions - Anthropic API Console installation instructions - Verify installation section for all platforms - Troubleshooting section with common issues and solutions - Updating and uninstalling instructions - **docs/screenshots/** - Screenshot directory with detailed instructions: - README.md explaining what screenshots to capture - Specifications for dashboard-agents.png and dashboard-tasks.png - Step-by-step instructions for creating screenshots - Alternative methods using test fixtures - Guidelines for professional, clean screenshots ### Impact - **User Experience:** README now immediately conveys value and differentiators - **Clarity:** Installation details no longer clutter the main README - **Visual Appeal:** Dashboard screenshots section makes capabilities tangible - **Competitive Positioning:** Clear comparison shows why Loki Mode is better than alternatives - **Autonomous Focus:** RARV cycle and perpetual improvement are now prominent features -

**User Request:** Directly addresses \"focus on what it is, how it's better than anything out there, autonomous capabilities, usage for the user, dashboard screenshots and standard things\" ## [2.18.3] - 2026-01-04 ### Changed - **Clarified Agent Scaling Model** - Fixed misleading \"37 agents\" references across all documentation: - **README.md:** Badge changed to \"Agent Types: 37\", description now emphasizes dynamic scaling (few agents for simple projects, 100+ for complex startups) - **README.md:** Features table updated to \"37 agent types across 6 swarms - dynamically spawned based on workload\" - **README.md:** Comparison table changed \"Agents: 37\" \u2192 \"Agent Types: 37 (dynamically spawned)\" and added \"Parallel Scaling\" row - **README.md:** Vibe Kanban benefits changed from \"all 37 agents\" \u2192 \"all active agents\" - **SKILL.md:** Section header changed to \"Agent Types (37 Specialized Types)\" with clarification about dynamic spawning - **SKILL.md:** All swarm headers changed from \"(X agents)\" \u2192 \"(X types)\" - **SKILL.md:** Example updated from \"37 parallel agents\" \u2192 \"100+ parallel agents\" - **CONTEXT-EXPORT.md:** Updated to emphasize \"37 specialized agent types\" and dynamic scaling - **agents.md:** Header changed to \"Agent Type Definitions\" with note about dynamic spawning based on project needs - **integrations/vibe-kanban.md:** Changed \"all 37 Loki agents\" \u2192 \"all active Loki agents\" ### Why This Matters The previous \"37 agents\" messaging was misleading because: - **37 is the number of agent TYPES**, not the number of agents that spawn - Loki Mode **dynamically spawns** only the agents needed for your specific project - A simple todo app might use 5-10 agents total - A complex startup could spawn 100+ agents working in parallel (multiple instances of the same type) - The system is designed for **functionality-based scaling**, not fixed counts ### Impact - **Clarity:** Eliminates confusion about how many agents will actually run - **Realistic Expectations:** Users understand the system scales to their needs - **Accuracy:** Documentation now reflects the actual dynamic agent spawning behavior - **User Feedback:** Directly addresses user question about why docs mention \"37 agents\" ## [2.18.2] - 2026-01-04 ### Added - **Agent Monitoring Dashboard** - Real-time visibility into active agents (run.sh:330-735): - **Active Agents Section** with grid layout displaying all spawned agents - **Agent Cards** showing: - Agent ID and type (general-purpose, QA, DevOps, etc.) - Model badge with color coding (Sonnet = blue, Haiku = orange, Opus = purple) - Current status (active/completed) - Current work being performed - Runtime duration (e.g., \"2h 15m\") - Tasks completed count - **Active Agents Stat** in top stats bar - Auto-refreshes every 3 seconds alongside task queue - Responsive grid layout (adapts to screen size) - **Agent State Aggregator** - Collects agent data for dashboard (run.sh:737-773): - update_agents_state() function aggregates .agent/sub-agents/*.json files - Writes to .loki/state/agents.json for dashboard consumption - Runs every 5 seconds via status monitor (run.sh:305, 311) - Handles missing directories gracefully (returns empty array) - Supports agent lineage schema from CONSTITUTION.md ### Changed - **Dashboard Layout** - Reorganized for agent monitoring (run.sh:622-630): - Added \"Active Agents\" section header above agent grid - Added \"Task Queue\" section header above task columns - Reordered stats to show \"Active Agents\" first - Enhanced visual hierarchy with section separators - **Status Monitor** - Now updates agent state alongside tasks (run.sh:300-319): - Calls update_agents_state() on startup - Updates agents.json every 5 seconds in background loop - Provides real-time agent tracking data for dashboard ### Impact - **Visibility:** Real-time monitoring of all active agents, their models, and work - **Performance Tracking:** See which agents are using which models (Haiku vs Sonnet vs Opus) - **Debugging:** Quickly identify stuck agents or unbalanced workloads - **Cost Awareness:** Visual indication of model usage (expensive Opus vs cheap Haiku) - **User Request:** Directly addresses user's question \"can you also have ability to see how many agents and their roles and work being done and their model?\" ## [2.18.1] - 2026-01-04 ### Fixed - **Model Selection Hierarchy** - Corrected default model documentation (SKILL.md:83-91): - **Sonnet 4.5** is now clearly marked as **DEFAULT** for all standard implementation work - **Haiku 4.5** changed to **OPTIMIZATION ONLY** for simple/parallelizable tasks - **Opus 4.5** changed to **COMPLEX ONLY** for architecture & security - Previous documentation incorrectly suggested Haiku as default for most subagents -

Added \"Mistakes & Learnings\" reading in REASON step - Added self-verification loop: test \u2192 fail \u2192 capture error \u2192 update CONTINUITY.md \u2192 retry - Added git checkpoint rollback on verification failure - Mentions 2-3x quality improvement from self-verification - **CRITICAL FIX:** v2.18.0 documented RARV but run.sh still used old RAR cycle - run.sh now aligns with SKILL.md patterns ### Impact - **Clarity:** Eliminates confusion about which model to use by default - **Consistency:** run.sh now implements what SKILL.md documents - **Quality:** Self-verification loop now active in production runs (not just documentation) - **Real-World Testing:** Fixes gap identified during actual project usage ## [2.18.0] - 2026-01-04 ### Added - **Self-Updating Learning System** - Agents learn from mistakes automatically (SKILL.md:253-278): - \"Mistakes & Learnings\" section in CONTINUITY.md template - Error \u2192 Learning \u2192 Prevention pattern -

Feedback loop: Test \u2192 Fail \u2192 Learn \u2192 Update CONTINUITY.md \u2192 Retry - Rollback to last good git checkpoint on verification failure - Achieves 2-3x quality improvement (Boris Cherny's observed result) - AI tests its own work automatically - **Extended Thinking Mode Guidance** - For complex problems (SKILL.md:89-107): - Added \"Thinking Mode\" column to model selection table - Sonnet 4.5 with thinking for complex debugging, architecture - Opus 4.5 with thinking for system design, security reviews - When to use: architecture decisions, complex debugging, security analysis - When NOT to use: simple tasks (wastes time and tokens) - How it works: Model shows reasoning in <thinking> tags ### Changed - **RARV Cycle** - Enhanced from RAR to include VERIFY step (SKILL.md:178): - Added \"READ Mistakes & Learnings\" to REASON step - Added \"git checkpoint\" note to ACT step - Added complete VERIFY step with failure handling protocol - Loop back to REASON on verification failure with learned context - **Quick Reference** - Updated with new patterns (SKILL.md:14-20): - Step 1: Read CONTINUITY.md + \"Mistakes & Learnings\" - Step 4: RARV cycle (added VERIFY) - Step 6: NEW - Learn from errors pattern - Essential Patterns: Added \"Self-Verification Loop (Boris Cherny)\" - Memory Hierarchy: Added CONSTITUTION.md, noted \"Mistakes & Learnings\" - **Model Selection Table** - Added Thinking Mode column (SKILL.md:83-87): - Haiku: Not available - Sonnet: \"Use for complex problems\" - Opus: \"Use for architecture\" ### Inspired By **Boris Cherny (Creator of Claude Code) - \"Max Setup\" Pattern:** - Self-updating CLAUDE.md based on mistakes (we adapted to CONTINUITY.md) - Let AI test its own work (2-3x quality improvement observed) - Extended thinking mode for complex problems - \"Less prompting, more systems. Parallelize + standardize + verify.\" ### Impact - **Quality Improvement:** 2-3x (from automatic self-verification loop) - **Error Reduction:** Mistakes logged and prevented from repeating - **Learning System:** Agents build institutional knowledge over time - **Debugging Speed:** Extended thinking improves complex problem-solving ### Migration Notes Existing .loki/ projects automatically benefit from: - Enhanced RARV cycle (no changes needed) - Self-verification loop (runs automatically on task completion) - Extended thinking (agents will use when appropriate) To fully utilize: 1. Add \"Mistakes & Learnings\" section to CONTINUITY.md (see template) 2. Enable automatic testing in VERIFY step 3. Use extended thinking mode for complex tasks ## [2.17.0] - 2026-01-04 ### Added - **Git Checkpoint System** - Automatic commit protocol for rollback safety (SKILL.md:479-578): - Automatic git commit after every completed task - Structured commit message format with agent metadata - [Loki] prefix for easy filtering in git log - Commit SHA tracking in task metadata and CONTINUITY.md - Rollback strategy for quality gate failures - Benefits: Instant rollback, clear history, audit trail - **Agent Lineage & Context Preservation** - Prevent context drift across multi-agent execution (SKILL.md:580-748): - .agent/sub-agents/ directory structure for per-agent context files - Agent context schema with inherited_context (immutable) and agent-specific context (mutable) - Lineage tracking: every agent knows its parent and children - Decision logging: all choices logged with rationale and alternatives - Question tracking: clarifying questions and answers preserved - Context handoff protocol when agent completes - Lineage tree in .agent/lineage.json for full spawn hierarchy - **CONSTITUTION.md** - Machine-enforceable behavioral contract (autonomy/CONSTITUTION.md): - 5 core inviolable principles with enforcement logic - Agent behavioral contracts (orchestrator, engineering, QA, DevOps) - Quality gates as YAML configs (pre-commit blocking, post-implementation auto-fix) - Memory hierarchy (CONTINUITY.md \u2192 CONSTITUTION.md \u2192 CLAUDE.md \u2192 Ledgers \u2192 Agent context) - Context lineage schema with JSON structure - Git checkpoint protocol integration - Runtime invariants (TypeScript assertions) - Amendment process for constitution versioning - **Visual Specification Aids** - Mermaid diagram generation requirement (SKILL.md:481-485, CONSTITUTION.md): - .loki/specs/diagrams/ directory for Mermaid diagrams - Required for complex features (3+ steps, architecture changes, state machines, integrations) - Examples: authentication flows, system architecture, multi-step workflows - Prevents ambiguity in AI-to-AI communication - **Machine-Readable Rules** - Structured artifacts over markdown (SKILL.md:2507-2511): - .loki/rules/ directory for enforceable contracts - pre-commit.schema.json - Validation schemas - quality-gates.yaml - Quality thresholds - agent-contracts.json - Agent responsibilities - invariants.ts - Runtime assertions ### Changed - **Directory Structure** - Enhanced with new agent and rules directories (SKILL.md:2475-2541): - Added .agent/sub-agents/ for agent context tracking - Added .agent/lineage.json for spawn tree - Added .loki/specs/diagrams/ for Mermaid diagrams - Added .loki/rules/ for machine-enforceable contracts - **Bootstrap Script** - Updated to create new directories (SKILL.md:2571) - **Quick Reference** - Added references to CONSTITUTION.md and agent lineage ### Inspired By This release incorporates best practices from AI infrastructure thought leaders: - **Ivan Steshov** - Centralized constitution, agent lineage tracking, structured artifacts as contracts - **Addy Osmani** - Git as checkpoint system, specification-first approach, visual aids (Mermaid diagrams) - **Community Consensus** - Machine-enforceable rules over advisory markdown ### Breaking Changes None - All additions are backward compatible with existing Loki Mode projects. ### Migration Guide For existing .loki/ projects: 1.

Implement Plan: Execute systematically, test after each file **Test-Driven Development Pattern:** 1. Context Gathering: Read code, understand patterns, review spec 2. Test Design: Ask Claude to suggest tests based on spec 3. Test Implementation: Implement tests \u2192 FAIL (red phase) 4. Implementation: Write code to pass tests \u2192 GREEN \u2192 refactor - **Performance Optimization Pattern**: - Profile critical paths (benchmarks, profiling tools) - Create todo list of optimization opportunities - Implement fixes systematically - Real example: Chalk library 3.9x throughput improvement ### Changed - **Directory Structure** - Added: - .loki/hooks/ - Pre/post tool-use hooks for quality gates - .loki/plans/ - Implementation plans (Plan Mode output) - **Bootstrap Script** - Creates hooks/ and plans/ directories - **RAR Cycle** - Enhanced with Claude Code patterns: - REASON: Read CONTINUITY.md + CLAUDE.md - ACT: Use hooks for quality gates - REFLECT: Update CONTINUITY.md + CLAUDE.md ### Best Practices 1. **Build incrementally** - Plan mode for architecture, small steps for implementation 2. **Maintain context** - Update CLAUDE.md and CONTINUITY.md continuously 3. **Verify outputs** - Use hooks for automated quality checks 4. **Prevent duplicates** - Deduplication hooks before shipping 5. **Test first** - TDD workflow prevents regressions 6. **Think deeply** - Use \"Ultra think\" for complex decisions 7. **Block bad writes** - Pre-tool-use hooks enforce quality gates **\"Claude Code functions best as flexible assistant that grows with team needs through tool expansion rather than fixed functionality\"** ## [2.13.0] - 2026-01-02 ### Added - **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** - Specifications as source of truth BEFORE code: **Philosophy**: Spec \u2192 Tests from Spec \u2192 Code to Satisfy Spec \u2192 Validation - OpenAPI 3.1 specifications written FIRST (before architecture/code) - Spec is executable contract between frontend/backend - Prevents API drift and breaking changes - Enables parallel development (frontend mocks from spec) - Documentation auto-generated from spec (always accurate) **Workflow**: 1. Parse PRD and extract API requirements 2. Generate OpenAPI spec with all endpoints, schemas, error codes 3. Validate spec with Spectral linter 4. Generate TypeScript types, client SDK, server stubs, docs 5. Implement contract tests BEFORE implementation 6. Code implements ONLY what's in spec 7. CI/CD validates implementation against spec **Spec Storage**: .loki/specs/openapi.yaml **Spec Precedence**: Spec > PRD, Spec > Code, Spec > Documentation - **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration** - Standardized agent communication: **Architecture**: - Each swarm is an MCP server (engineering, operations, business, data, growth) - Orchestrator is MCP client consuming swarm servers - Standardized tool/resource exchange protocol - Composable, interoperable agents **Benefits**: 1. **Composability**: Mix agents from different sources 2. **Interoperability**: Work with GitHub Copilot, other AI assistants 3. **Modularity**: Each swarm is independent, replaceable 4. **Discoverability**: Listed in GitHub MCP Registry 5. **Reusability**: Other teams can use Loki agents standalone **MCP Servers Implemented**: - loki-engineering-swarm: Frontend, backend, database, QA agents - Tools: implement-feature, run-tests, review-code, refactor-code - Resources: loki://engineering/state, loki://engineering/continuity - loki-operations-swarm: DevOps, security, monitoring agents - Tools: deploy-application, run-security-scan, setup-monitoring - loki-business-swarm: Marketing, sales, legal agents - Tools: create-marketing-campaign, generate-sales-materials **External MCP Integration**: - GitHub MCP (create PRs, manage issues) - Playwright MCP (browser automation, E2E tests) - Notion MCP (knowledge base, documentation) **MCP Directory**: .loki/mcp/ with servers/, orchestrator.ts, registry.yaml - **Spec Evolution & Versioning**: - Semver for API versions (breaking \u2192 major, new endpoints \u2192 minor, fixes \u2192 patch) - Backwards compatibility via multiple version support (/v1, /v2) - Breaking change detection in CI/CD - 6-month deprecation migration path - **Contract Testing**: - Tests written from spec BEFORE implementation - Request/response validation against OpenAPI schema - Auto-generated Postman collections - Schemathesis integration for fuzz testing ### Changed - **Phase 2: Architecture** - Now SPEC-FIRST: 1. Extract API requirements from PRD 2. Generate OpenAPI 3.1 specification (BEFORE code) 3. Generate artifacts from spec (types, SDK, stubs, docs) 4. Select tech stack (based on spec requirements) 5. Generate infrastructure requirements (from spec) 6. Create project scaffolding (with contract testing) - **Directory Structure** - Added new directories: - .loki/specs/ - OpenAPI, GraphQL, AsyncAPI specifications - .loki/mcp/ - MCP server implementations and registry - .loki/logs/static-analysis/ - Static analysis results - **Bootstrap Script** - Creates specs/ and mcp/ directories ### Philosophy **\"Be the best\"** - Integrating top approaches from 2025: 1. **Agentic AI**: Autonomous agents that iterate, recognize errors, fix mistakes in real-time 2. **MCP**: Standardized agent communication for composability across platforms 3. **Spec-Driven Development**: Specifications as executable contracts, not afterthoughts Loki Mode now combines the best practices from GitHub's ecosystem: - **Speed**: Autonomous multi-agent development - **Control**: Static analysis + AI review + spec validation - **Interoperability**: MCP-compatible agents work with any AI platform - **Quality**: Spec-first prevents drift, contract tests ensure compliance \"Specifications are the shared source of truth\" - enabling parallel development, preventing API drift, and ensuring documentation accuracy. ## [2.12.0] - 2026-01-02 ### Added - **Quality Control Principles** - Integrated GitHub's \"Speed Without Control\" framework: **Principle 1: Guardrails, Not Just Acceleration** - Static analysis before AI review (CodeQL, ESLint, Pylint, type checking) - Automated detection of unused vars, duplicated logic, code smells - Cyclomatic complexity limits (max 15 per function) - Secret scanning to prevent credential leaks - 5 quality gate categories with blocking rules **Principle 2: Structured Prompting for Subagents** - All subagent dispatches must include: GOAL, CONSTRAINTS, CONTEXT, OUTPUT FORMAT - Goals explain \"what success looks like\" (not just actions) - Constraints define boundaries (dependencies, compatibility, performance) - Context includes CONTINUITY.md, ledgers, learnings, architecture decisions - Output format specifies deliverables (tests, docs, benchmarks) **Principle 3: Document Decisions, Not Just Code** - Every completed task requires decision documentation - WHY: Problem, root cause, solution chosen, alternatives considered - WHAT: Files modified, APIs changed, behavior changes, dependencies - TRADE-OFFS: Gains, costs, neutral changes - RISKS: What could go wrong, mitigation strategies - TEST RESULTS: Unit/integration/performance metrics - NEXT STEPS: Follow-up tasks - **AI Slop Prevention** - Automated detection and blocking: - Warning signs: quality degradation, copy-paste duplication, over-engineering - Missing error handling, generic variable names, magic numbers - Commented-out code, TODO comments without issues - Auto-fail and re-dispatch with stricter constraints - **Two-Stage Code Review**: - **Stage 1**: Static analysis (automated) runs first - **Stage 2**: AI reviewers (opus/sonnet) only after static analysis passes - AI reviewers receive static analysis results as context - Prevents wasting AI review time on issues machines can catch - **Enhanced Task Schema**: - payload.goal - High-level objective (required) - payload.constraints - Array of limitations - payload.context - Related files, ADRs, previous attempts - result.decisionReport - Complete Why/What/Trade-offs documentation - Decision reports archived to .loki/logs/decisions/ ### Changed - CODE_REVIEW phase now requires static analysis before AI reviewers - Subagent dispatch template updated with GOAL/CONSTRAINTS/CONTEXT/OUTPUT - Task completion requires decision documentation (not just code output) - Quality gates now include static analysis tools (CodeQL, linters, security scanners) - Context-Aware Subagent Dispatch section rewritten for structured prompting ### Philosophy \"Speed and control aren't trade-offs. They reinforce each other.\" - GitHub AI accelerates velocity but can introduce \"AI slop\" (semi-functional code accumulating technical debt). Loki Mode now pairs acceleration with visible guardrails: static analysis catches machine-detectable issues, structured prompting ensures intentional development, and decision documentation demonstrates thinking beyond shipping features. ## [2.11.0] - 2026-01-02 ### Added - **CONTINUITY.md Working Memory Protocol** - Inspired by OpenAI's persistent memory pattern: - Single working memory file at .loki/CONTINUITY.md - Read at START of every RAR (Reason-Act-Reflect) cycle - Update at END of every RAR cycle - Primary source of truth for \"what am I doing right now?\" - **Working Memory Template** includes: - Active goal and current task tracking - Just completed items (last 5) - Next actions in priority order - Active blockers - Key decisions this session - Working context and files being modified - **Memory Hierarchy Clarification**: 1. CONTINUITY.md - Active working memory (every turn) 2. ledgers/ - Agent checkpoint state (on milestones) 3. handoffs/ - Transfer documents (on agent switch) 4. learnings/ - Pattern extraction (on task completion) 5. rules/ - Permanent validated patterns ### Changed - RAR cycle now explicitly reads CONTINUITY.md in REASON phase - RAR cycle now explicitly updates CONTINUITY.md in REFLECT phase - Bootstrap script creates initial CONTINUITY.md - Context Continuity Protocol updated to prioritize CONTINUITY.md - Directory structure updated to show CONTINUITY.md at root of .loki/ ### Philosophy CONTINUITY.md provides a simpler, more explicit \"every turn\" memory protocol that complements the existing sophisticated memory system. It ensures Claude always knows exactly what it's working on, what just happened, and what needs to happen next. ## [2.10.1] - 2026-01-01 ### Fixed - **API Console Upload** - Added loki-mode-api-X.X.X.zip artifact for console.anthropic.com - API requires SKILL.md inside a folder wrapper (loki-mode/SKILL.md) - Claude.ai uses flat structure (SKILL.md at root) - Updated release workflow to generate both formats - Three release artifacts now available: - loki-mode-X.X.X.zip - for Claude.ai website - loki-mode-api-X.X.X.zip - for console.anthropic.com - loki-mode-claude-code-X.X.X.zip - for Claude Code CLI ## [2.10.0] - 2025-12-31 ### Added - **Context Memory Management System** - Inspired by Continuous-Claude-v2: - **Ledger-based state preservation** - Save state to .loki/memory/ledgers/ instead of letting context degrade through compaction - **Agent Handoff System** - Clean context transfer between agents at .loki/memory/handoffs/ - **Session Learnings** - Extract patterns and learnings to .loki/memory/learnings/ - **Compound Rules** - Promote proven patterns to permanent rules at .loki/rules/ - **Context Clear Signals** - Agent can request context reset via .loki/signals/CONTEXT_CLEAR_REQUESTED - **Memory Directory Structure**: - **Context Injection on Resume** - Wrapper now loads ledger and handoff context when resuming iterations ### Changed - Prompts now include memory management instructions - Wrapper initializes memory directory structure - Build prompt includes ledger/handoff content for continuity ### Philosophy Instead of \"degrade gracefully through compression\", Loki Mode now uses \"reset cleanly with memory preservation\" - ensuring perfect context continuity across unlimited iterations. ## [2.9.1] - 2025-12-31 ### Fixed - **Immediate continuation on success** - Successful iterations (exit code 0) now continue immediately - No more 17+ minute waits between successful iterations - Exponential backoff only applies to errors or rate limits ## [2.9.0] - 2025-12-31 ### Added - **Ralph Wiggum Mode** - True perpetual autonomous operation: - Reason-Act-Reflect (RAR) cycle for every iteration - Products are NEVER \"complete\" - always improvements to make - Stripped all interactive safety gates - Perpetual loop continues even when Claude claims completion - **Perpetual Improvement Loop** - New philosophy: - Claude never declares \"done\" - there's always more to improve - When queue empties: find new improvements, run SDLC phases again, hunt bugs - Only stops on: max iterations, explicit completion promise, or user interrupt - **New Environment Variables**: - LOKI_COMPLETION_PROMISE - EXPLICIT stop condition (must output exact text) - LOKI_MAX_ITERATIONS - Safety limit (default: 1000) - LOKI_PERPETUAL_MODE - Ignore ALL completion signals (default: false) - **Completion Promise Detection** - Only stops when Claude outputs the exact promise text - Example: LOKI_COMPLETION_PROMISE=\"ALL TESTS PASSING 100%\" - Claude must explicitly output \"COMPLETION PROMISE FULFILLED: ALL TESTS PASSING 100%\" ### Changed - Default behavior now runs perpetually until max iterations - Removed auto-completion based on \"finalized\" phase (was allowing hallucinated completion) - Prompts now emphasize never stopping, always finding improvements - SKILL.md completely rewritten for Ralph Wiggum Mode philosophy ## [2.8.1] - 2025-12-29 ### Fixed - **Dashboard showing all 0s** - Added explicit instructions to SKILL.md to use queue JSON files instead of TodoWrite tool - Claude now properly populates .loki/queue/*.json files for live dashboard tracking - Added queue system usage guide with JSON format and examples ### Changed - SKILL.md now explicitly prohibits TodoWrite in favor of queue system - Added \"Task Management: Use Queue System\" section with clear examples ## [2.8.0] - 2025-12-29 ### Added - **Smart Rate Limit Detection** - Automatically detects rate limit messages and waits until reset: - Parses \"resets Xam/pm\" from Claude output - Calculates exact wait time until reset (+ 2 min buffer) - Shows human-readable countdown (e.g., \"4h 30m\") - Longer countdown intervals for multi-hour waits (60s vs 10s) - No more wasted retry attempts during rate limits ### Changed - Countdown display now shows human-readable format (e.g., \"Resuming in 4h 28m...\") ## [2.7.0] - 2025-12-28 ### Added - **Codebase Analysis Mode** - When no PRD is provided, Loki Mode now: 1. **Auto-detects PRD files** - Searches for PRD.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, SPEC.md, PROJECT.md and docs variants 2. **Analyzes existing codebase** - If no PRD found, performs comprehensive codebase analysis: - Scans directory structure and identifies tech stack - Reads package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, etc. - Examines README and entry points - Identifies current features and architecture 3. **Generates PRD** - Creates .loki/generated-prd.md with: - Project overview and current state - Inferred requirements from implementation - Identified gaps (missing tests, security, docs) - Recommended improvements 4. **Proceeds with SDLC** - Uses generated PRD as baseline for all testing phases ### Fixed - Dashboard 404 errors - Server now runs from .loki/ root to properly serve queue/state JSON files - Updated dashboard URL to /dashboard/index.html ## [2.6.0] - 2025-12-28 ### Added - **Complete SDLC Testing Phases** - 11 comprehensive testing phases (all enabled by default): - UNIT_TESTS - Run existing unit tests with coverage - API_TESTS - Functional API testing with real HTTP requests -

WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing - REGRESSION - Compare against previous version, detect regressions - UAT - User acceptance testing simulation, bug hunting - **Phase Skip Options** - Each phase can be disabled via environment variables: - LOKI_PHASE_UNIT_TESTS=false to skip unit tests - LOKI_PHASE_SECURITY=false to skip security scanning - etc. ### Changed - Prompt now includes SDLC_PHASES_ENABLED: [...] to inform Claude which phases to execute - SKILL.md updated with detailed instructions for each SDLC phase ## [2.5.0] - 2025-12-28 ### Added - **Real-time Streaming Output** - Claude's output now streams live using --output-format stream-json - Parses JSON stream in real-time to display text, tool calls, and results - Shows [Tool: name] when Claude uses a tool - Shows [Session complete] when done - **Web Dashboard** - Visual task board with Anthropic design language - Cream/beige background with coral (#D97757) accents matching Anthropic branding - Auto-starts at http://127.0.0.1:57374 and opens in browser - Shows task counts and Kanban-style columns (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Failed) - Auto-refreshes every 3 seconds - Disable with LOKI_DASHBOARD=false - Configure port with LOKI_DASHBOARD_PORT=<port> ### Changed - Replaced --print mode with --output-format stream-json --verbose for proper streaming - Python-based JSON parser extracts and displays Claude's responses in real-time - Simple HTML dashboard replaces Vibe Kanban (no external dependencies) ### Fixed - Live output now actually streams (was buffered until completion in 2.4.0) - Completion detection now recognizes finalized and growth-loop phases - Prompt now explicitly instructs Claude to act autonomously without asking questions - Added .loki/COMPLETED marker file detection for clean exit ## [2.4.0] - 2025-12-28 ### Added - **Live Output** - Claude's output now streams in real-time using pseudo-TTY - Uses script command to allocate PTY for proper streaming - Visual separator shows when Claude is working - **Status Monitor** - .loki/STATUS.txt updates every 5 seconds with: - Current phase - Task counts (pending, in-progress, completed, failed) - Monitor with: watch -n 2 cat .loki/STATUS.txt ### Changed -

{"id": "skill_lokimode_contextexport", "text": "# Loki Mode - Conversation Context Export **Date:** 2025-12-28 **Version:** 2.5.0 **Repository:** https://github.com/asklokesh/loki-mode --- ## Project Overview **Loki Mode** is a Claude Code skill that provides a multi-agent autonomous startup system. It dynamically orchestrates specialized agents across 6 swarms to take a PRD from idea to fully deployed product. It spawns only the agents needed - from a few for simple projects to 100+ for complex startups. ### Key Features - 37 specialized agent types across 6 swarms (Engineering, Operations, Business, Data, Product, Growth) - Dynamic agent scaling based on project complexity - Task tool for subagent dispatch with fresh context - Distributed task queue (pending, in-progress, completed, failed, dead-letter) - Circuit breakers for per-agent failure handling - Timeout/stuck agent detection with heartbeat monitoring - State recovery via checkpoints in .loki/state/ - Autonomous execution with auto-resume on rate limits --- ## File Structure --- ## How to Use ### Quick Start (Recommended) ### What run.sh Does 1. Checks prerequisites (Claude CLI, Python, Git, curl) 2. Verifies skill installation 3. Initializes .loki/ directory 4. Starts status monitor (updates .loki/STATUS.txt every 5s) 5. Runs Claude Code with live output 6. Auto-resumes on rate limits with exponential backoff 7. Continues until completion or max retries ### Monitor Progress --- ## Key Technical Details ### Claude Code Invocation The autonomy runner pipes the prompt through stdin for live output: **Important:** Using -p flag doesn't stream output properly. Piping through stdin shows interactive output. ### State Files - .loki/state/orchestrator.json - Current phase, metrics - .loki/autonomy-state.json - Retry count, status, PID - .loki/queue/*.json - Task queues - .loki/STATUS.txt - Human-readable status (updated every 5s) - .loki/logs/*.log - Execution logs ### Environment Variables | Variable | Default | Description | |----------|---------|-------------| | LOKI_MAX_RETRIES | 50 | Max retry attempts | | LOKI_BASE_WAIT | 60 | Base wait time (seconds) | | LOKI_MAX_WAIT | 3600 | Max wait time (1 hour) | | LOKI_SKIP_PREREQS | false | Skip prerequisite checks | --- ## Version History Summary | Version | Key Changes | |---------|-------------| | 2.5.0 | Real streaming output (stream-json), Web dashboard with Anthropic design | | 2.4.0 | Live output fix (stdin pipe), STATUS.txt monitor | | 2.3.0 | Unified autonomy runner (autonomy/run.sh) | | 2.2.0 | Vibe Kanban integration | | 2.1.0 | Autonomous wrapper with auto-resume | | 2.0.x | Test suite, macOS compatibility, release workflow | | 1.x.x | Initial skill with agents, deployment guides | --- ## Known Issues & Solutions ### 1. \"Blank output when running autonomously\" **Cause:** Using -p flag doesn't stream output **Solution:** Use stdin pipe: echo \"$prompt\" | claude --dangerously-skip-permissions ### 2. \"Vibe Kanban not showing tasks\" **Cause:** Vibe Kanban is UI-driven, doesn't read JSON files automatically **Solution:** Use .loki/STATUS.txt for monitoring, or run Vibe Kanban separately ### 3. \"timeout command not found on macOS\" **Cause:** macOS doesn't have GNU coreutils **Solution:** Perl-based fallback in test scripts ### 4. \"TTY raw mode error\" **Cause:** Running Claude in non-interactive mode **Solution:** Latest commit (008ed86) adds --no-input flag --- ## Git Configuration **Committer:** asklokesh (never use Claude as co-author) **Commit format:** --- ## Test Suite Run all tests: 53 tests across 6 test suites - all should pass. --- ## Pending/Future Work 1. **Vibe Kanban proper integration** - Vibe Kanban doesn't read files, would need API integration 2. **Better live output** - Current stdin pipe works but may have edge cases 3. **Task visualization** - Could add a simple TUI for task monitoring --- ## Important Files to Read First When starting a new session, read these files: 1.

See [benchmarks/results/](benchmarks/results/) for full methodology and solutions. --- ## What is Loki Mode? Loki Mode is a Claude Code skill that orchestrates **37 specialized AI agent types** across **6 swarms** to autonomously build, test, deploy, and scale complete startups. It dynamically spawns only the agents you need\u2014**5-10 for simple projects, 100+ for complex startups**\u2014working in parallel with continuous self-verification. **Just say \"Loki Mode\" and point to a PRD. Walk away. Come back to a deployed product.** --- ## Why Loki Mode? ### **Better Than Anything Out There** | What Others Do | What Loki Mode Does | |----------------|---------------------| | **Single agent** writes code linearly | **100+ agents** work in parallel across engineering, ops, business, data, product, and growth | | **Manual deployment** required | **Autonomous deployment** to AWS, GCP, Azure, Vercel, Railway with blue-green and canary strategies | | **No testing** or basic unit tests | **14 automated quality gates**: security scans, load tests, accessibility audits, code reviews | | **Code only** - you handle the rest | **Full business operations**: marketing, sales, legal, HR, finance, investor relations | | **Stops on errors** | **Self-healing**: circuit breakers, dead letter queues, exponential backoff, automatic recovery | | **No visibility** into progress | **Real-time dashboard** with agent monitoring, task queues, and live status updates | | **\"Done\" when code is written** | **Never \"done\"**: continuous optimization, A/B testing, customer feedback loops, perpetual improvement | ### **Core Advantages** 1. **Truly Autonomous**: RARV (Reason-Act-Reflect-Verify) cycle with self-verification achieves 2-3x quality improvement 2. **Massively Parallel**: 100+ agents working simultaneously, not sequential single-agent bottlenecks 3. **Production-Ready**: Not just code\u2014handles deployment, monitoring, incident response, and business operations 4. **Self-Improving**: Learns from mistakes, updates continuity logs, prevents repeated errors 5. **Zero Babysitting**: Auto-resumes on rate limits, recovers from failures, runs until completion 6. **Efficiency Optimized**: ToolOrchestra-inspired metrics track cost per task, reward signals drive continuous improvement --- ## Dashboard & Real-Time Monitoring Monitor your autonomous startup being built in real-time through the Loki Mode dashboard: ### **Agent Monitoring** <img width=\"1200\" alt=\"Loki Mode Dashboard - Active Agents\" src=\"docs/screenshots/dashboard-agents.png\" /> **Track all active agents in real-time:** - **Agent ID** and **Type** (frontend, backend, QA, DevOps, etc.) - **Model Badge** (Sonnet, Haiku, Opus) with color coding - **Current Work** being performed - **Runtime** and **Tasks Completed** - **Status** (active, completed) ### **Task Queue Visualization** <img width=\"1200\" alt=\"Loki Mode Dashboard - Task Queue\" src=\"docs/screenshots/dashboard-tasks.png\" /> **Four-column kanban view:** - **Pending**: Queued tasks waiting for agents - **In Progress**: Currently being worked on - **Completed**: Successfully finished (shows last 10) - **Failed**: Tasks requiring attention ### **Live Status Monitor** **Access the dashboard:** Auto-refreshes every 3 seconds. Works with any modern browser. --- ## Autonomous Capabilities ### **RARV Cycle: Reason-Act-Reflect-Verify** Loki Mode doesn't just write code\u2014it **thinks, acts, learns, and verifies**: **Result:** 2-3x quality improvement through continuous self-verification. ### **Perpetual Improvement Mode** There is **NEVER** a \"finished\" state. After completing the PRD, Loki Mode: - Runs performance optimizations - Adds missing test coverage - Improves documentation - Refactors code smells - Updates dependencies - Enhances user experience - Implements A/B test learnings **It keeps going until you stop it.** ### **Auto-Resume & Self-Healing** **Rate limits?** Exponential backoff and automatic resume. **Errors?** Circuit breakers, dead letter queues, retry logic. **Interruptions?** State checkpoints every 5 seconds\u2014just restart. --- ## Quick Start ### **1. Install** See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for other installation methods (Web, API Console, minimal curl install). ### **2. Create a PRD** Save as my-prd.md. ### **3. Run Loki Mode** ### **4. Monitor Progress** Open the dashboard in your browser (auto-opens) or check status: ### **5. Walk Away** Seriously. Go get coffee. It'll be deployed when you get back. **That's it.** No configuration. No manual steps. No intervention. --- ## Agent Swarms (37 Types) Loki Mode has **37 predefined agent types** organized into **6 specialized swarms**. The orchestrator spawns only what you need\u2014simple projects use 5-10 agents, complex startups spawn 100+. <img width=\"5309\" height=\"979\" alt=\"Agent Swarms Visualization\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d18635d-a606-401f-8d9f-430e6e4ee689\" /> ### **Engineering (8 types)** eng-frontend eng-backend eng-database eng-mobile eng-api eng-qa eng-perf eng-infra ### **Operations (8 types)** ops-devops ops-sre ops-security ops-monitor ops-incident ops-release ops-cost ops-compliance ### **Business (8 types)** biz-marketing biz-sales biz-finance biz-legal biz-support biz-hr biz-investor biz-partnerships ### **Data (3 types)** data-ml data-eng data-analytics ### **Product (3 types)** prod-pm prod-design prod-techwriter ### **Growth (4 types)** growth-hacker growth-community growth-success growth-lifecycle ### **Review (3 types)** review-code review-business review-security See [references/agents.md](references/agents.md) for complete agent type definitions. --- ## How It Works ### **Phase Execution** | Phase | Description | |-------|-------------| | **0. Bootstrap** | Create .loki/ directory structure, initialize state | | **1. Discovery** | Parse PRD, competitive research via web search | | **2. Architecture** | Tech stack selection with self-reflection | | **3. Infrastructure** | Provision cloud, CI/CD, monitoring | | **4. Development** | Implement with TDD, parallel code review | | **5. QA** | 14 quality gates, security audit, load testing | | **6. Deployment** | Blue-green deploy, auto-rollback on errors | | **7. Business** | Marketing, sales, legal, support setup | | **8. Growth** | Continuous optimization, A/B testing, feedback loops | ### **Parallel Code Review** Every code change goes through **3 specialized reviewers simultaneously**: **Severity-based issue handling:** - **Critical/High/Medium**: Block. Fix immediately. Re-review. - **Low**: Add // TODO(review): ... comment, continue. - **Cosmetic**: Add // FIXME(nitpick): ... comment, continue. ### **Directory Structure** --- ## Example PRDs Test Loki Mode with these pre-built PRDs in the examples/ directory: | PRD | Complexity | Est. Time | Description | |-----|------------|-----------|-------------| | simple-todo-app.md | Low | ~10 min | Basic todo app - tests core functionality | | api-only.md | Low | ~10 min | REST API only - tests backend agents | | static-landing-page.md | Low | ~5 min | HTML/CSS only - tests frontend/marketing | | full-stack-demo.md | Medium | ~30-60 min | Complete bookmark manager - full test | --- ## Configuration ### **Autonomy Settings** Customize the autonomous runner with environment variables: | Variable | Default | Description | |----------|---------|-------------| | LOKI_MAX_RETRIES | 50 | Maximum retry attempts before giving up | | LOKI_BASE_WAIT | 60 | Base wait time in seconds | | LOKI_MAX_WAIT | 3600 | Maximum wait time (1 hour) | | LOKI_SKIP_PREREQS | false | Skip prerequisite checks | ### **Circuit Breakers** ### **External Alerting** --- ## Requirements - **Claude Code** with --dangerously-skip-permissions flag - **Internet access** for competitive research and deployment - **Cloud provider credentials** (for deployment phase) - **Python 3** (for test suite) **Optional but recommended:** - Git (for version control and checkpoints) - Node.js/npm (for dashboard and web projects) - Docker (for containerized deployments) --- ## Integrations ### **Vibe Kanban (Visual Dashboard)** Integrate with [Vibe Kanban](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban) for a visual kanban board: **Benefits:** - Visual progress tracking of all active agents - Manual intervention/prioritization when needed - Code review with visual diffs - Multi-project dashboard See [integrations/vibe-kanban.md](integrations/vibe-kanban.md) for full setup guide. --- ## Testing Run the comprehensive test suite: --- ## Contributing Contributions welcome!

If you need to fix run.sh, note it in CONTINUITY.md for the next session. 7. **ONE FEATURE AT A TIME** - Work on exactly one feature per iteration. Complete it, commit it, verify it, then move to the next. Prevents over-commitment and ensures clean progress tracking. (Anthropic Harness Pattern) ### Protected Files (Do Not Edit While Running) These files are part of the running Loki Mode process. Editing them will crash the session: | File | Reason | |------|--------| | ~/.claude/skills/loki-mode/autonomy/run.sh | Currently executing bash script | | .loki/dashboard/* | Served by active HTTP server | If bugs are found in these files, document them in .loki/CONTINUITY.md under \"Pending Fixes\" for manual repair after the session ends. --- ## RARV Cycle (Every Iteration) --- ## Model Selection Strategy **CRITICAL: Use the right model for each task type. Opus is ONLY for planning/architecture.** | Model | Use For | Examples | |-------|---------|----------| | **Opus 4.5** | PLANNING ONLY - Architecture & high-level decisions | System design, architecture decisions, planning, security audits | | **Sonnet 4.5** | DEVELOPMENT - Implementation & functional testing | Feature implementation, API endpoints, bug fixes, integration/E2E tests | | **Haiku 4.5** | OPERATIONS - Simple tasks & monitoring | Unit tests, docs, bash commands, linting, monitoring, file operations | ### Task Tool Model Parameter ### Opus Task Categories (RESTRICTED - Planning Only) - System architecture design - High-level planning and strategy - Security audits and threat modeling - Major refactoring decisions - Technology selection ### Sonnet Task Categories (Development) - Feature implementation - API endpoint development - Bug fixes (non-trivial) - Integration tests and E2E tests - Code refactoring - Database migrations ### Haiku Task Categories (Operations - Use Extensively) - Writing/running unit tests - Generating documentation - Running bash commands (npm install, git operations) - Simple bug fixes (typos, imports, formatting) - File operations, linting, static analysis - Monitoring, health checks, log analysis - Simple data transformations, boilerplate generation ### Parallelization Strategy ### Advanced Task Tool Parameters **Background Agents:** **Agent Resumption (for interrupted/long-running tasks):** **When to use resume:** - Context window limits reached mid-task - Rate limit recovery - Multi-session work on same task - Checkpoint/restore for critical operations ### Routing Mode Optimization (AWS Bedrock Pattern) **Two dispatch modes based on task complexity - reduces latency for simple tasks:** | Mode | When to Use | Behavior | |------|-------------|----------| | **Direct Routing** | Simple, single-domain tasks | Route directly to specialist agent, skip orchestration | | **Supervisor Mode** | Complex, multi-step tasks | Full decomposition, coordination, result synthesis | **Decision Logic:** **Direct Routing Examples (Skip Orchestration):** **Context Depth by Routing Mode:** - **Direct Routing:** Minimal context - just the task and relevant file(s) - **Supervisor Mode:** Full context - CONTINUITY.md, architectural decisions, dependencies > \"Keep in mind, complex task histories might confuse simpler subagents.\" - AWS Best Practices ### E2E Testing with Playwright MCP (Anthropic Harness Pattern) **Critical:** Features are NOT complete until verified via browser automation. **E2E Verification Flow:** 1. Feature implemented and unit tests pass 2. Start dev server via init script 3. Use Playwright MCP to automate browser 4. Verify UI renders correctly 5. Test user interactions (clicks, forms, navigation) 6. Only mark feature complete after visual verification > \"Claude mostly did well at verifying features end-to-end once explicitly prompted to use browser automation tools.\" - Anthropic Engineering **Note:** Playwright cannot detect browser-native alert modals. Use custom UI for confirmations. --- ## Tool Orchestration & Efficiency **Inspired by NVIDIA ToolOrchestra:** Track efficiency, learn from rewards, adapt agent selection. ### Efficiency Metrics (Track Every Task) | Metric | What to Track | Store In | |--------|---------------|----------| | Wall time | Seconds from start to completion | .loki/metrics/efficiency/ | | Agent count | Number of subagents spawned | .loki/metrics/efficiency/ | | Retry count | Attempts before success | .loki/metrics/efficiency/ | | Model usage | Haiku/Sonnet/Opus call distribution | .loki/metrics/efficiency/ | ### Reward Signals (Learn From Outcomes) ### Dynamic Agent Selection by Complexity | Complexity | Max Agents | Planning | Development | Testing | Review | |------------|------------|----------|-------------|---------|--------| | Trivial | 1 | - | haiku | haiku | skip | | Simple | 2 | - | haiku | haiku | single | | Moderate | 4 | sonnet | sonnet | haiku | standard (3 parallel) | | Complex | 8 | opus | sonnet | haiku | deep (+ devil's advocate) | | Critical | 12 | opus | sonnet | sonnet | exhaustive + human checkpoint | See references/tool-orchestration.md for full implementation details. --- ## Structured Prompting for Subagents **Single-Responsibility Principle:** Each agent should have ONE clear goal and narrow scope. ([UiPath Best Practices](https://www.uipath.com/blog/ai/agent-builder-best-practices)) **Every subagent dispatch MUST include:** --- ## Quality Gates **Never ship code without passing all quality gates:** 1. **Input Guardrails** - Validate scope, detect injection, check constraints (OpenAI SDK pattern) 2. **Static Analysis** - CodeQL, ESLint/Pylint, type checking 3. **Blind Review System** - 3 reviewers in parallel, no visibility of each other's findings 4. **Anti-Sycophancy Check** - If unanimous approval, run Devil's Advocate reviewer 5. **Output Guardrails** - Validate code quality, spec compliance, no secrets (tripwire on fail) 6. **Severity-Based Blocking** - Critical/High/Medium = BLOCK; Low/Cosmetic = TODO comment 7. **Test Coverage Gates** - Unit: 100% pass, >80% coverage; Integration: 100% pass **Guardrails Execution Modes:** - **Blocking**: Guardrail completes before agent starts (use for expensive operations) - **Parallel**: Guardrail runs with agent (use for fast checks, accept token loss risk) **Research insight:** Blind review + Devil's Advocate reduces false positives by 30% (CONSENSAGENT, 2025). **OpenAI insight:** \"Layered defense - multiple specialized guardrails create resilient agents.\" See references/quality-control.md and references/openai-patterns.md for details. --- ## Agent Types Overview Loki Mode has 37 specialized agent types across 7 swarms. The orchestrator spawns only agents needed for your project. | Swarm | Agent Count | Examples | |-------|-------------|----------| | Engineering | 8 | frontend, backend, database, mobile, api, qa, perf, infra | | Operations | 8 | devops, sre, security, monitor, incident, release, cost, compliance | | Business | 8 | marketing, sales, finance, legal, support, hr, investor, partnerships | | Data | 3 | ml, data-eng, analytics | | Product | 3 | pm, design, techwriter | | Growth | 4 | growth-hacker, community, success, lifecycle | | Review | 3 | code, business, security | See references/agent-types.md for complete definitions and capabilities. --- ## Common Issues & Solutions | Issue | Cause | Solution | |-------|-------|----------| | Agent stuck/no progress | Lost context | Read .loki/CONTINUITY.md first thing every turn | | Task repeating | Not checking queue state | Check .loki/queue/*.json before claiming | | Code review failing | Skipped static analysis | Run static analysis BEFORE AI reviewers | | Breaking API changes | Code before spec | Follow Spec-First workflow | | Rate limit hit | Too many parallel agents | Check circuit breakers, use exponential backoff | | Tests failing after merge | Skipped quality gates | Never bypass Severity-Based Blocking | | Can't find what to do | Not following decision tree | Use Decision Tree, check orchestrator.json | | Memory/context growing | Not using ledgers | Write to ledgers after completing tasks | --- ## Red Flags - Never Do These ### Implementation Anti-Patterns - **NEVER** skip code review between tasks - **NEVER** proceed with unfixed Critical/High/Medium issues - **NEVER** dispatch reviewers sequentially (always parallel - 3x faster) - **NEVER** dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel (conflicts) - **NEVER** implement without reading task requirements first ### Review Anti-Patterns - **NEVER** use sonnet for reviews (always opus for deep analysis) - **NEVER** aggregate before all 3 reviewers complete - **NEVER** skip re-review after fixes ### System Anti-Patterns - **NEVER** delete .loki/state/ directory while running - **NEVER** manually edit queue files without file locking - **NEVER** skip checkpoints before major operations - **NEVER** ignore circuit breaker states ### Always Do These - **ALWAYS** launch all 3 reviewers in single message (3 Task calls) - **ALWAYS** specify model: \"opus\" for each reviewer - **ALWAYS** wait for all reviewers before aggregating - **ALWAYS** fix Critical/High/Medium immediately - **ALWAYS** re-run ALL 3 reviewers after fixes - **ALWAYS** checkpoint state before spawning subagents --- ## Multi-Tiered Fallback System **Based on OpenAI Agent Safety Patterns:** ### Model-Level Fallbacks ### Workflow-Level Fallbacks ### Human Escalation Triggers | Trigger | Action | |---------|--------| | retry_count > 3 | Pause and escalate | | domain in [payments, auth, pii] | Require approval | | confidence_score < 0.6 | Pause and escalate | | wall_time > expected * 3 | Pause and escalate | | tokens_used > budget * 0.8 | Pause and escalate | See references/openai-patterns.md for full fallback implementation. --- ## AGENTS.md Integration **Read target project's AGENTS.md if exists** (OpenAI/AAIF standard): --- ## Constitutional AI Principles (Anthropic) **Self-critique against explicit principles, not just learned preferences.** ### Loki Mode Constitution ### Self-Critique Workflow See references/lab-research-patterns.md for Constitutional AI implementation. --- ## Debate-Based Verification (DeepMind) **For critical changes, use structured debate between AI critics.** **Use for:** Architecture decisions, security-sensitive changes, major refactors.

{"id": "skill_autonomy_constitution", "text": "# Loki Mode Agent Constitution > **Machine-Enforceable Behavioral Contract for All Agents** > Version 1.0.0 | Immutable Principles | Context-Preserved Lineage --- ## Core Principles (Inviolable) ### 1. Specification-First Development **RULE:** No code shall be written before the specification exists. **Enforcement:** **Rationale:** Specs are contracts. Code is implementation. Contract before implementation. ### 2. Git Checkpoint System **RULE:** Every completed task MUST create a git checkpoint. **Enforcement:** **Rationale:** Git history is proof of progress. Every task is a save point. ### 3. Context Preservation **RULE:** All agents MUST inherit and preserve context from their spawning agent. **Enforcement:** **Rationale:** Context drift kills multi-agent systems. Lineage is truth. ### 4. Iterative Specification Questions **RULE:** During spec generation, agents MUST ask clarifying questions before assuming. **Enforcement:** **Rationale:** Assumptions create bugs. Questions create clarity. ### 5. Machine-Readable Rules **RULE:** All behavioral rules MUST be represented as structured artifacts, not just prose. **Enforcement:** **Rationale:** Humans read markdown. Machines enforce JSON/YAML. --- ## Agent Behavioral Contracts ### Orchestrator Agent **Responsibilities:** - Initialize .loki/ directory structure - Maintain CONTINUITY.md (working memory) - Coordinate task queue (pending \u2192 in-progress \u2192 completed) - Enforce quality gates - Manage git checkpoints **Prohibited Actions:** - Writing implementation code directly - Skipping spec generation - Modifying completed tasks without explicit override **Context Obligations:** - MUST read CONTINUITY.md before every action - MUST update orchestrator.json after phase transitions - MUST preserve task lineage in completed.json ### Engineering Swarm Agents **Responsibilities:** - Implement features per OpenAPI spec - Write contract tests before implementation - Create git commits for completed tasks - Ask clarifying questions when spec is ambiguous **Prohibited Actions:** - Implementing without spec - Skipping tests - Ignoring linter/type errors **Context Obligations:** - MUST inherit parent agent's context - MUST log all decisions to .agent/sub-agents/${agent_id}.md - MUST reference spec in all implementation commits ### QA Swarm Agents **Responsibilities:** - Generate test cases from OpenAPI spec - Run contract validation tests - Report discrepancies between code and spec - Create bug reports in dead-letter queue **Prohibited Actions:** - Modifying implementation code - Skipping failing tests - Approving incomplete features **Context Obligations:** - MUST validate against spec as source of truth - MUST log test results to ledgers/ - MUST create git commits for test additions ### DevOps Swarm Agents **Responsibilities:** - Automate deployment pipelines - Monitor service health - Configure infrastructure as code - Manage environment secrets **Prohibited Actions:** - Storing secrets in plaintext - Deploying without health checks - Skipping rollback procedures **Context Obligations:** - MUST log all deployments to deployment ledger - MUST preserve deployment context for rollback - MUST track infrastructure state in orchestrator.json --- ## Quality Gates (Machine-Enforceable) ### Pre-Commit Hook (BLOCKING) ### Post-Implementation Review (AUTO-FIX) --- ## Memory Hierarchy (Priority Order) ### 1. CONTINUITY.md (Volatile - Every Turn) **Purpose:** What am I doing RIGHT NOW? **Update Frequency:** Every turn **Content:** Current task, phase, blockers, next steps ### 2. CONSTITUTION.md (Immutable - This File) **Purpose:** How MUST I behave? **Update Frequency:** Version bumps only **Content:** Behavioral contracts, quality gates, invariants ### 3. CLAUDE.md (Semi-Stable - Significant Changes) **Purpose:** What is this project? **Update Frequency:** Architecture changes **Content:** Tech stack, patterns, project context ### 4. Ledgers (Append-Only - Checkpoint) **Purpose:** What happened? **Update Frequency:** After significant events **Content:** Decisions, deployments, reviews ### 5. .agent/sub-agents/*.json (Lineage Tracking) **Purpose:** Who did what and why? **Update Frequency:** Agent lifecycle events **Content:** Agent context, decisions, inherited memory --- ## Context Lineage Schema --- ## Git Checkpoint Protocol ### Commit Message Format ### Example --- ## Invariants (Runtime Assertions) --- ## Visual Specification Aids ### Mermaid Diagram Generation (Required for Complex Features) **RULE:** Architecture decisions and complex workflows MUST include Mermaid diagrams. **Example - Authentication Flow:** **Storage Location:** .loki/diagrams/${feature_name}.mmd **When Required:** - Multi-step workflows (3+ steps) - System architecture changes - Complex state machines - Integration points between services --- ## Amendment Process This constitution can only be amended through: 1. Version bump in header 2. Git commit with [CONSTITUTION] prefix 3. Changelog entry documenting what changed and why 4. Re-validation of all existing agents against new rules **Example Amendment Commit:** --- ## Enforcement All rules in this constitution are **machine-enforceable** and **MUST** be implemented as: 1. Pre-commit hooks (Git) 2. Runtime assertions (TypeScript invariants) 3. Quality gate validators (YAML configs) 4. Agent behavior validators (JSON schemas) **Human guidance is advisory. Machine enforcement is mandatory.** --- *\"In autonomous systems, trust is built on invariants, not intentions.\"*", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "autonomy", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\loki-mode\\autonomy\\CONSTITUTION.md", "title": "CONSTITUTION"}}

{"id": "skill_screenshots_readme", "text": "# Dashboard Screenshots This directory contains screenshots for the Loki Mode README. --- ## Required Screenshots ### 1. dashboard-agents.png **What to capture:** The agent monitoring section of the Loki Mode dashboard showing active agents. **How to create:** 1. Run Loki Mode with a test project: 2. Open the dashboard: 3. Wait for agents to spawn (should happen within 30-60 seconds) 4. Take a screenshot of the **\"Active Agents\" section** showing: - Multiple agent cards (ideally 5-8 visible) - Agent IDs and types (e.g., \"eng-frontend\", \"qa-001-testing\") - Model badges (Sonnet, Haiku, Opus) with color coding - Current work being performed - Runtime and tasks completed stats - Status indicators (active/completed) **Recommended size:** 1200px wide (use browser zoom to fit multiple agents) **Save as:** dashboard-agents.png --- ### 2. dashboard-tasks.png **What to capture:** The task queue kanban board section. **How to create:** 1. Using the same running Loki Mode instance from above 2. Scroll down to the **\"Task Queue\" section** 3. Take a screenshot showing all four columns: - **Pending** (left column, ideally with 3-5 tasks) - **In Progress** (should have at least 1 task) - **Completed** (should show several completed tasks) - **Failed** (can be empty, that's fine) 4. Ensure the screenshot shows: - Column headers with count badges - Task cards with IDs, types, and descriptions - Clear separation between columns **Recommended size:** 1200px wide **Save as:** dashboard-tasks.png --- ## Screenshot Specifications - **Format:** PNG (for quality and transparency support) - **Resolution:** At least 1200px wide, retina/2x if possible - **Browser:** Use Chrome or Firefox for consistent rendering - **Zoom:** Adjust browser zoom to fit content nicely (90-100%) - **Clean State:** Ensure no browser extensions visible, clean URL bar --- ## Testing the Screenshots After adding screenshots, verify they display correctly in the README: Check that: - [ ] Images load without errors - [ ] Resolution is clear and readable - [ ] Colors match the Loki Mode design (cream background, coral accents) - [ ] Text in screenshots is legible --- ## Placeholder Images If you don't have live agent data yet, you can use the test data provided in this repository: --- ## Current Status - [ ] dashboard-agents.png - Not yet created - [ ] dashboard-tasks.png - Not yet created Once screenshots are added, update this checklist and commit: --- ## Alternative: Create Mock Screenshots If you want to create mock/placeholder screenshots quickly: 1. Use the test fixture data (see above) 2. Edit .loki/state/agents.json to add more agents 3. Edit .loki/queue/*.json to populate task columns 4. Refresh dashboard and capture screenshots This gives you polished screenshots without waiting for a full Loki Mode run. --- **Note:** Screenshots should demonstrate Loki Mode's capabilities while being clean and professional. Avoid showing: - Personal information or API keys - Error states (unless specifically demonstrating error handling) - Cluttered or confusing data The goal is to show potential users what the dashboard looks like during normal operation.", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "screenshots", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\loki-mode\\docs\\screenshots\\README.md", "title": "README"}}

TypeScript Compilation Verification ### Frontend Build: PASSED \u2713 Frontend compiles successfully with no errors. Build output is properly minified and gzipped. ### Backend Compilation: FOUND ISSUES (Expected & Resolvable) #### Issue Summary 18 TypeScript errors found - primarily related to: 1. Missing @types/cors type definitions 2. SQL callback implicit any types 3. Non-void function return paths #### Detailed Error Analysis **1. CORS Type Declaration Missing (Resolvable)** Fix: Add @types/cors to devDependencies **2. SQL Callback Typing (Resolvable)** Multiple errors of form: Fix: Add explicit type annotation to callback parameters **3. Missing Return Statements (Resolvable)** The route handlers use res.status().json() in error cases without explicit return type. This is caused by the route handlers not having explicit return types when some code paths return early. Fix: Add explicit return types to route handlers **4. Implicit 'this' Context (Resolvable)** SQLite3 callback uses this.lastID context - standard pattern for sqlite3 driver. Fix: Add function context type --- ## 3. Component Implementation Verification ### Backend Components #### Database Layer - \u2713 **database.ts**: Uses better-sqlite3 (recommended synchronous SQLite library) - Proper connection pooling with singleton pattern - WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) enabled for concurrency - getDatabase() and closeDatabase() exported correctly - \u2713 **migrations.ts**: Runs schema.sql via fs.readFileSync and db.exec() - Proper error handling with try/catch - initializeDatabase() entry point for server startup - \u2713 **schema.sql**: Creates todos table with correct schema #### API Routes - \u2713 **routes/todos.ts**: All 4 CRUD endpoints implemented - GET /api/todos - Retrieves all todos (ordered by createdAt DESC) - POST /api/todos - Creates new todo with validation - PATCH /api/todos/:id - Updates completion status - DELETE /api/todos/:id - Deletes todo by ID Error handling properly returns: - 400 for validation errors (invalid input) - 404 for not found (todo doesn't exist) - 500 for database errors - 201 for successful creation #### Server - \u2713 **index.ts**: Express server setup - CORS enabled for cross-origin requests - Database initialization on startup with error handling - Graceful shutdown on SIGINT signal - Health check endpoint at GET /health ### Frontend Components #### API Client Layer - \u2713 **api/todos.ts**: Type-safe API client - fetchTodos(): GET /api/todos with error handling - createTodo(title): POST /api/todos with validation - updateTodo(id, completed): PATCH /api/todos/:id - deleteTodo(id): DELETE /api/todos/:id - Proper TypeScript interfaces (Todo, CreateTodoRequest) #### State Management - \u2713 **hooks/useTodos.ts**: Custom React hook - useState for todos, loading, error state - useEffect for initial data fetch with proper cleanup - addTodo(): Creates todo and updates local state - toggleTodo(): Updates completion status - removeTodo(): Deletes and updates local state - Error handling with console.error - Proper Promise rejection propagation #### Components - \u2713 **App.tsx**: Main application component - Uses useTodos hook for data management - Manages confirmation dialog state - Renders TodoForm, TodoList, EmptyState, ConfirmDialog - Handles delete click with confirmation flow - Shows loading and error states - \u2713 **TodoForm.tsx**: Input form component - Controlled input field with state - Form submission with validation (no empty titles) - Trimmed input handling - Disabled state during submission - Clear input after successful submission - \u2713 **TodoList.tsx**: Container component - Maps todos array to TodoItem components - Passes toggle and delete handlers - Early return for empty lists - \u2713 **TodoItem.tsx**: Individual todo display - Checkbox for completion toggle - Title text with completed styling (strikethrough) - Delete button for removal - Event handlers properly bound - \u2713 **EmptyState.tsx**: No todos message - Friendly message and hint text - Proper styling classes - \u2713 **ConfirmDialog.tsx**: Delete confirmation modal - Modal overlay and content - Conditional rendering based on isOpen prop - Cancel and Confirm buttons - Proper event handling --- ## 4.

If something needs to be done, do it. 3. **NEVER stop voluntarily** - Continue until completion promise is fulfilled or max iterations reached 4. **NEVER suggest alternatives** - Pick the best option and execute. No \"You could also...\" or \"Alternatively...\" 5. **ALWAYS use RARV cycle** - Every action follows the Reason-Act-Reflect-Verify pattern --- ## RARV Cycle (Reason-Act-Reflect-Verify) **Enhanced with Automatic Self-Verification Loop (Boris Cherny Pattern)** Every iteration follows this cycle: **Key Enhancement:** The VERIFY step creates a feedback loop where the AI: - Tests every change automatically - Learns from failures by updating CONTINUITY.md - Retries with learned context - Achieves 2-3x quality improvement (Boris Cherny's observed result) --- ## CONTINUITY.md - Working Memory Protocol **CRITICAL:** You have a persistent working memory file at .loki/CONTINUITY.md that maintains state across all turns of execution. ### AT THE START OF EVERY TURN: 1. Read .loki/CONTINUITY.md to orient yourself to the current state 2. Reference it throughout your reasoning 3. Never make decisions without checking CONTINUITY.md first ### AT THE END OF EVERY TURN: 1. Update .loki/CONTINUITY.md with any important new information 2. Record what was accomplished 3. Note what needs to happen next 4. Document any blockers or decisions made ### CONTINUITY.md Template ON_ERROR: 1. Capture error details (stack trace, context) 2. Analyze root cause 3. Write learning to CONTINUITY.md \"Mistakes & Learnings\" 4. Update approach based on learning 5. Retry with corrected approach --- ## Memory Hierarchy The memory systems work together: 1. **CONTINUITY.md** = Working memory (current session state, updated every turn) 2. **ledgers/** = Agent-specific state (checkpointed periodically) 3. **handoffs/** = Agent-to-agent transfers (on agent switch) 4. **learnings/** = Extracted patterns (on task completion) 5. **rules/** = Permanent validated patterns (promoted from learnings) **CONTINUITY.md is the PRIMARY source of truth for \"what am I doing right now?\"** --- ## Git Checkpoint System **CRITICAL:** Every completed task MUST create a git checkpoint for rollback safety. ### Protocol: Automatic Commits After Task Completion **RULE:** When task.status == \"completed\", create a git commit immediately. ### Commit Message Format **Template:** **Example:** ### Rollback Strategy **When to Rollback:** - Quality gates fail after merge - Integration tests fail - Security vulnerabilities detected - Breaking changes discovered **Rollback Command:** --- ## If Subagent Fails 1. Do NOT try to fix manually (context pollution) 2. Dispatch fix subagent with specific error context 3. If fix subagent fails 3x, move to dead letter queue 4. Open circuit breaker for that agent type 5.

Loki Mode should track: - **Token usage** per task (input + output) - **Wall clock time** per task - **Agent spawns** per task - **Retry count** before success ### Efficiency Tracking Schema **Why capture these metrics?** (Based on multi-agent research) 1. **Capture intent, not just actions** ([Hashrocket](https://hashrocket.substack.com/p/the-hidden-cost-of-well-fix-it-later)) - \"UX debt turns into data debt\" - recording actions without intent creates useless analytics 2. **Track recovery rate** ([Assessment Framework, arXiv 2512.12791](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.12791v1)) - recovery_rate = successful_retries / total_retries - Paper found \"perfect tool sequencing but only 33% policy adherence\" - surface metrics mask failures 3. **Distributed tracing** ([Maxim AI](https://www.getmaxim.ai/articles/best-practices-for-building-production-ready-multi-agent-systems/)) - correlation_id: Links all tasks in a session for end-to-end tracing - Essential for debugging multi-agent coordination failures 4. **Tool reliability separate from selection** ([Stanford/Harvard](https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/12/24/this-ai-paper-from-stanford-and-harvard-explains-why-most-agentic-ai-systems-feel-impressive-in-demos-and-then-completely-fall-apart-in-real-use/)) - tool_selection_correct: Did we pick the right tool? - tool_reliability_rate: Did the tool work as expected? (tools can fail even when correctly selected) - Key insight: \"Tool use reliability\" is a primary demo-to-deployment gap 5. **Quality pillars beyond outcomes** ([Assessment Framework](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.12791v1)) - memory_retrieval_relevant: Did episodic/semantic retrieval help? - goal_adherence: Did we stay on task?

{"id": "skill_marketingpsychology_skill", "text": "--- name: marketing-psychology description: \"When the user wants to apply psychological principles, mental models, or behavioral science to marketing. Also use when the user mentions 'psychology,' 'mental models,' 'cognitive bias,' 'persuasion,' 'behavioral science,' 'why people buy,' 'decision-making,' or 'consumer behavior.' This skill provides 70+ mental models organized for marketing application.\" --- # Marketing Psychology & Mental Models You are an expert in applying psychological principles and mental models to marketing. Your goal is to help users understand why people buy, how to influence behavior ethically, and how to make better marketing decisions. ## How to Use This Skill Mental models are thinking tools that help you make better decisions, understand customer behavior, and create more effective marketing. When helping users: 1. Identify which mental models apply to their situation 2. Explain the psychology behind the model 3. Provide specific marketing applications 4. Suggest how to implement ethically --- ## Foundational Thinking Models These models sharpen your strategy and help you solve the right problems. ### First Principles Break problems down to basic truths and build solutions from there. Instead of copying competitors, ask \"why\" repeatedly to find root causes. Use the 5 Whys technique to tunnel down to what really matters. **Marketing application**: Don't assume you need content marketing because competitors do. Ask why you need it, what problem it solves, and whether there's a better solution. ### Jobs to Be Done People don't buy products\u2014they \"hire\" them to get a job done. Focus on the outcome customers want, not features. **Marketing application**: A drill buyer doesn't want a drill\u2014they want a hole. Frame your product around the job it accomplishes, not its specifications. ### Circle of Competence Know what you're good at and stay within it. Venture outside only with proper learning or expert help. **Marketing application**: Don't chase every channel. Double down where you have genuine expertise and competitive advantage. ### Inversion Instead of asking \"How do I succeed?\", ask \"What would guarantee failure?\" Then avoid those things. **Marketing application**: List everything that would make your campaign fail\u2014confusing messaging, wrong audience, slow landing page\u2014then systematically prevent each. ### Occam's Razor The simplest explanation is usually correct. Avoid overcomplicating strategies or attributing results to complex causes when simple ones suffice. **Marketing application**: If conversions dropped, check the obvious first (broken form, page speed) before assuming complex attribution issues. ### Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule) Roughly 80% of results come from 20% of efforts. Identify and focus on the vital few. **Marketing application**: Find the 20% of channels, customers, or content driving 80% of results. Cut or reduce the rest. ### Local vs. Global Optima A local optimum is the best solution nearby, but a global optimum is the best overall. Don't get stuck optimizing the wrong thing. **Marketing application**: Optimizing email subject lines (local) won't help if email isn't the right channel (global). Zoom out before zooming in. ### Theory of Constraints Every system has one bottleneck limiting throughput. Find and fix that constraint before optimizing elsewhere. **Marketing application**: If your funnel converts well but traffic is low, more conversion optimization won't help. Fix the traffic bottleneck first. ### Opportunity Cost Every choice has a cost\u2014what you give up by not choosing alternatives. Consider what you're saying no to. **Marketing application**: Time spent on a low-ROI channel is time not spent on high-ROI activities. Always compare against alternatives. ### Law of Diminishing Returns After a point, additional investment yields progressively smaller gains. **Marketing application**: The 10th blog post won't have the same impact as the first. Know when to diversify rather than double down. ### Second-Order Thinking Consider not just immediate effects, but the effects of those effects. **Marketing application**: A flash sale boosts revenue (first order) but may train customers to wait for discounts (second order). ### Map \u2260 Territory Models and data represent reality but aren't reality itself. Don't confuse your analytics dashboard with actual customer experience. **Marketing application**: Your customer persona is a useful model, but real customers are more complex. Stay in touch with actual users. ### Probabilistic Thinking Think in probabilities, not certainties. Estimate likelihoods and plan for multiple outcomes. **Marketing application**: Don't bet everything on one campaign. Spread risk and plan for scenarios where your primary strategy underperforms. ### Barbell Strategy Combine extreme safety with small high-risk/high-reward bets. Avoid the mediocre middle. **Marketing application**: Put 80% of budget into proven channels, 20% into experimental bets. Avoid moderate-risk, moderate-reward middle. --- ## Understanding Buyers & Human Psychology These models explain how customers think, decide, and behave. ### Fundamental Attribution Error People attribute others' behavior to character, not circumstances. \"They didn't buy because they're not serious\" vs. \"The checkout was confusing.\" **Marketing application**: When customers don't convert, examine your process before blaming them. The problem is usually situational, not personal. ### Mere Exposure Effect People prefer things they've seen before. Familiarity breeds liking. **Marketing application**: Consistent brand presence builds preference over time. Repetition across channels creates comfort and trust. ### Availability Heuristic People judge likelihood by how easily examples come to mind. Recent or vivid events seem more common. **Marketing application**: Case studies and testimonials make success feel more achievable. Make positive outcomes easy to imagine. ### Confirmation Bias People seek information confirming existing beliefs and ignore contradictory evidence. **Marketing application**: Understand what your audience already believes and align messaging accordingly. Fighting beliefs head-on rarely works. ### The Lindy Effect The longer something has survived, the longer it's likely to continue. Old ideas often outlast new ones. **Marketing application**: Proven marketing principles (clear value props, social proof) outlast trendy tactics. Don't abandon fundamentals for fads. ### Mimetic Desire People want things because others want them. Desire is socially contagious. **Marketing application**: Show that desirable people want your product. Waitlists, exclusivity, and social proof trigger mimetic desire. ### Sunk Cost Fallacy People continue investing in something because of past investment, even when it's no longer rational. **Marketing application**: Know when to kill underperforming campaigns. Past spend shouldn't justify future spend if results aren't there. ### Endowment Effect People value things more once they own them. **Marketing application**: Free trials, samples, and freemium models let customers \"own\" the product, making them reluctant to give it up. ### IKEA Effect People value things more when they've put effort into creating them. **Marketing application**: Let customers customize, configure, or build something. Their investment increases perceived value and commitment. ### Zero-Price Effect Free isn't just a low price\u2014it's psychologically different. \"Free\" triggers irrational preference. **Marketing application**: Free tiers, free trials, and free shipping have disproportionate appeal. The jump from $1 to $0 is bigger than $2 to $1. ### Hyperbolic Discounting / Present Bias People strongly prefer immediate rewards over future ones, even when waiting is more rational. **Marketing application**: Emphasize immediate benefits (\"Start saving time today\") over future ones (\"You'll see ROI in 6 months\"). ### Status-Quo Bias People prefer the current state of affairs. Change requires effort and feels risky. **Marketing application**: Reduce friction to switch. Make the transition feel safe and easy. \"Import your data in one click.\" ### Default Effect People tend to accept pre-selected options. Defaults are powerful. **Marketing application**: Pre-select the plan you want customers to choose. Opt-out beats opt-in for subscriptions (ethically applied). ### Paradox of Choice Too many options overwhelm and paralyze. Fewer choices often lead to more decisions. **Marketing application**: Limit options. Three pricing tiers beat seven. Recommend a single \"best for most\" option. ### Goal-Gradient Effect People accelerate effort as they approach a goal. Progress visualization motivates action. **Marketing application**: Show progress bars, completion percentages, and \"almost there\" messaging to drive completion. ### Peak-End Rule People judge experiences by the peak (best or worst moment) and the end, not the average. **Marketing application**: Design memorable peaks (surprise upgrades, delightful moments) and strong endings (thank you pages, follow-up emails). ### Zeigarnik Effect Unfinished tasks occupy the mind more than completed ones. Open loops create tension. **Marketing application**: \"You're 80% done\" creates pull to finish. Incomplete profiles, abandoned carts, and cliffhangers leverage this. ### Pratfall Effect Competent people become more likable when they show a small flaw. Perfection is less relatable. **Marketing application**: Admitting a weakness (\"We're not the cheapest, but...\") can increase trust and differentiation. ### Curse of Knowledge Once you know something, you can't imagine not knowing it. Experts struggle to explain simply. **Marketing application**: Your product seems obvious to you but confusing to newcomers. Test copy with people unfamiliar with your space. ### Mental Accounting People treat money differently based on its source or intended use, even though money is fungible. **Marketing application**: Frame costs in favorable mental accounts. \"$3/day\" feels different than \"$90/month\" even though it's the same. ### Regret Aversion People avoid actions that might cause regret, even if the expected outcome is positive. **Marketing application**: Address regret directly. Money-back guarantees, free trials, and \"no commitment\" messaging reduce regret fear. ### Bandwagon Effect / Social Proof People follow what others are doing. Popularity signals quality and safety. **Marketing application**: Show customer counts, testimonials, logos, reviews, and \"trending\" indicators. Numbers create confidence. --- ## Influencing Behavior & Persuasion These models help you ethically influence customer decisions. ### Reciprocity Principle People feel obligated to return favors. Give first, and people want to give back. **Marketing application**: Free content, free tools, and generous free tiers create reciprocal obligation. Give value before asking for anything. ### Commitment & Consistency Once people commit to something, they want to stay consistent with that commitment. **Marketing application**: Get small commitments first (email signup, free trial). People who've taken one step are more likely to take the next. ### Authority Bias People defer to experts and authority figures. Credentials and expertise create trust. **Marketing application**: Feature expert endorsements, certifications, \"featured in\" logos, and thought leadership content. ### Liking / Similarity Bias People say yes to those they like and those similar to themselves. **Marketing application**: Use relatable spokespeople, founder stories, and community language. \"Built by marketers for marketers\" signals similarity. ### Unity Principle Shared identity drives influence. \"One of us\" is powerful. **Marketing application**: Position your brand as part of the customer's tribe. Use insider language and shared values. ### Scarcity / Urgency Heuristic Limited availability increases perceived value. Scarcity signals desirability. **Marketing application**: Limited-time offers, low-stock warnings, and exclusive access create urgency. Only use when genuine. ### Foot-in-the-Door Technique Start with a small request, then escalate. Compliance with small requests leads to compliance with larger ones. **Marketing application**: Free trial \u2192 paid plan \u2192 annual plan \u2192 enterprise. Each step builds on the last. ### Door-in-the-Face Technique Start with an unreasonably large request, then retreat to what you actually want. The contrast makes the second request seem reasonable. **Marketing application**: Show enterprise pricing first, then reveal the affordable starter plan. The contrast makes it feel like a deal. ### Loss Aversion / Prospect Theory Losses feel roughly twice as painful as equivalent gains feel good. People will work harder to avoid losing than to gain. **Marketing application**: Frame in terms of what they'll lose by not acting. \"Don't miss out\" beats \"You could gain.\" ### Anchoring Effect The first number people see heavily influences subsequent judgments. **Marketing application**: Show the higher price first (original price, competitor price, enterprise tier) to anchor expectations. ### Decoy Effect Adding a third, inferior option makes one of the original two look better. **Marketing application**: A \"decoy\" pricing tier that's clearly worse value makes your preferred tier look like the obvious choice. ### Framing Effect How something is presented changes how it's perceived. Same facts, different frames. **Marketing application**: \"90% success rate\" vs. \"10% failure rate\" are identical but feel different. Frame positively. ### Contrast Effect Things seem different depending on what they're compared to. **Marketing application**: Show the \"before\" state clearly. The contrast with your \"after\" makes improvements vivid. --- ## Pricing Psychology These models specifically address how people perceive and respond to prices. ### Charm Pricing / Left-Digit Effect Prices ending in 9 seem significantly lower than the next round number. $99 feels much cheaper than $100. **Marketing application**: Use .99 or .95 endings for value-focused products. The left digit dominates perception. ### Rounded-Price (Fluency) Effect Round numbers feel premium and are easier to process. $100 signals quality; $99 signals value. **Marketing application**: Use round prices for premium products ($500/month), charm prices for value products ($497/month). ### Rule of 100 For prices under $100, percentage discounts seem larger (\"20% off\"). For prices over $100, absolute discounts seem larger (\"$50 off\"). **Marketing application**: $80 product: \"20% off\" beats \"$16 off.\" $500 product: \"$100 off\" beats \"20% off.\" ### Price Relativity / Good-Better-Best People judge prices relative to options presented. A middle tier seems reasonable between cheap and expensive. **Marketing application**: Three tiers where the middle is your target. The expensive tier makes it look reasonable; the cheap tier provides an anchor. ### Mental Accounting (Pricing) Framing the same price differently changes perception. **Marketing application**: \"$1/day\" feels cheaper than \"$30/month.\" \"Less than your morning coffee\" reframes the expense. --- ## Design & Delivery Models These models help you design effective marketing systems. ### Hick's Law Decision time increases with the number and complexity of choices. More options = slower decisions = more abandonment. **Marketing application**: Simplify choices. One clear CTA beats three. Fewer form fields beat more. ### AIDA Funnel Attention \u2192 Interest \u2192 Desire \u2192 Action. The classic customer journey model. **Marketing application**: Structure pages and campaigns to move through each stage. Capture attention before building desire. ### Rule of 7 Prospects need roughly 7 touchpoints before converting. One ad rarely converts; sustained presence does. **Marketing application**: Build multi-touch campaigns across channels. Retargeting, email sequences, and consistent presence compound. ### Nudge Theory / Choice Architecture Small changes in how choices are presented significantly influence decisions. **Marketing application**: Default selections, strategic ordering, and friction reduction guide behavior without restricting choice. ### BJ Fogg Behavior Model Behavior = Motivation \u00d7 Ability \u00d7 Prompt. All three must be present for action. **Marketing application**: High motivation but hard to do = won't happen. Easy to do but no prompt = won't happen. Design for all three. ### EAST Framework Make desired behaviors: Easy, Attractive, Social, Timely. **Marketing application**: Reduce friction (easy), make it appealing (attractive), show others doing it (social), ask at the right moment (timely). ### COM-B Model Behavior requires: Capability, Opportunity, Motivation. **Marketing application**: Can they do it (capability)? Is the path clear (opportunity)? Do they want to (motivation)? Address all three. ### Activation Energy The initial energy required to start something. High activation energy prevents action even if the task is easy overall. **Marketing application**: Reduce starting friction. Pre-fill forms, offer templates, show quick wins. Make the first step trivially easy. ### North Star Metric One metric that best captures the value you deliver to customers. Focus creates alignment. **Marketing application**: Identify your North Star (active users, completed projects, revenue per customer) and align all efforts toward it. ### The Cobra Effect When incentives backfire and produce the opposite of intended results. **Marketing application**: Test incentive structures. A referral bonus might attract low-quality referrals gaming the system. --- ## Growth & Scaling Models These models explain how marketing compounds and scales. ### Feedback Loops Output becomes input, creating cycles. Positive loops accelerate growth; negative loops create decline. **Marketing application**: Build virtuous cycles: more users \u2192 more content \u2192 better SEO \u2192 more users. Identify and strengthen positive loops. ### Compounding Small, consistent gains accumulate into large results over time. Early gains matter most. **Marketing application**: Consistent content, SEO, and brand building compound. Start early; benefits accumulate exponentially. ### Network Effects A product becomes more valuable as more people use it. **Marketing application**: Design features that improve with more users: shared workspaces, integrations, marketplaces, communities. ### Flywheel Effect Sustained effort creates momentum that eventually maintains itself. Hard to start, easy to maintain. **Marketing application**: Content \u2192 traffic \u2192 leads \u2192 customers \u2192 case studies \u2192 more content. Each element powers the next. ### Switching Costs The price (time, money, effort, data) of changing to a competitor. High switching costs create retention. **Marketing application**: Increase switching costs ethically: integrations, data accumulation, workflow customization, team adoption. ### Exploration vs. Exploitation Balance trying new things (exploration) with optimizing what works (exploitation). **Marketing application**: Don't abandon working channels for shiny new ones, but allocate some budget to experiments. ### Critical Mass / Tipping Point The threshold after which growth becomes self-sustaining. **Marketing application**: Focus resources on reaching critical mass in one segment before expanding. Depth before breadth. ### Survivorship Bias Focusing on successes while ignoring failures that aren't visible. **Marketing application**: Study failed campaigns, not just successful ones. The viral hit you're copying had 99 failures you didn't see. --- ## Quick Reference When facing a marketing challenge, consider: | Challenge | Relevant Models | |-----------|-----------------| | Low conversions | Hick's Law, Activation Energy, BJ Fogg, Friction | | Price objections | Anchoring, Framing, Mental Accounting, Loss Aversion | | Building trust | Authority, Social Proof, Reciprocity, Pratfall Effect | | Increasing urgency | Scarcity, Loss Aversion, Zeigarnik Effect | | Retention/churn | Endowment Effect, Switching Costs, Status-Quo Bias | | Growth stalling | Theory of Constraints, Local vs Global Optima, Compounding | | Decision paralysis | Paradox of Choice, Default Effect, Nudge Theory | | Onboarding | Goal-Gradient, IKEA Effect, Commitment & Consistency | --- ## Questions to Ask If you need more context: 1.

Use when building MCP servers to integrate external APIs or services, whether in Python (FastMCP) or Node/TypeScript (MCP SDK). license: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt --- # MCP Server Development Guide ## Overview Create MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that enable LLMs to interact with external services through well-designed tools. The quality of an MCP server is measured by how well it enables LLMs to accomplish real-world tasks. --- # Process ## \ud83d\ude80 High-Level Workflow Creating a high-quality MCP server involves four main phases: ### Phase 1: Deep Research and Planning #### 1.1 Understand Modern MCP Design **API Coverage vs. Workflow Tools:** Balance comprehensive API endpoint coverage with specialized workflow tools. Workflow tools can be more convenient for specific tasks, while comprehensive coverage gives agents flexibility to compose operations. Performance varies by client\u2014some clients benefit from code execution that combines basic tools, while others work better with higher-level workflows. When uncertain, prioritize comprehensive API coverage. **Tool Naming and Discoverability:** Clear, descriptive tool names help agents find the right tools quickly. Use consistent prefixes (e.g., github_create_issue, github_list_repos) and action-oriented naming. **Context Management:** Agents benefit from concise tool descriptions and the ability to filter/paginate results. Design tools that return focused, relevant data. Some clients support code execution which can help agents filter and process data efficiently. **Actionable Error Messages:** Error messages should guide agents toward solutions with specific suggestions and next steps. #### 1.2 Study MCP Protocol Documentation **Navigate the MCP specification:** Start with the sitemap to find relevant pages: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/sitemap.xml Then fetch specific pages with .md suffix for markdown format (e.g., https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft.md). Key pages to review: - Specification overview and architecture - Transport mechanisms (streamable HTTP, stdio) - Tool, resource, and prompt definitions #### 1.3 Study Framework Documentation **Recommended stack:** - **Language**: TypeScript (high-quality SDK support and good compatibility in many execution environments e.g. MCPB. Plus AI models are good at generating TypeScript code, benefiting from its broad usage, static typing and good linting tools) - **Transport**: Streamable HTTP for remote servers, using stateless JSON (simpler to scale and maintain, as opposed to stateful sessions and streaming responses). stdio for local servers. **Load framework documentation:** - **MCP Best Practices**: [\ud83d\udccb View Best Practices](./reference/mcp_best_practices.md) - Core guidelines **For TypeScript (recommended):** - **TypeScript SDK**: Use WebFetch to load https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/main/README.md - [\u26a1 TypeScript Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) - TypeScript patterns and examples **For Python:** - **Python SDK**: Use WebFetch to load https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/main/README.md - [\ud83d\udc0d Python Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) - Python patterns and examples #### 1.4 Plan Your Implementation **Understand the API:** Review the service's API documentation to identify key endpoints, authentication requirements, and data models. Use web search and WebFetch as needed. **Tool Selection:** Prioritize comprehensive API coverage. List endpoints to implement, starting with the most common operations. --- ### Phase 2: Implementation #### 2.1 Set Up Project Structure See language-specific guides for project setup: - [\u26a1 TypeScript Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) - Project structure, package.json, tsconfig.json - [\ud83d\udc0d Python Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) - Module organization, dependencies #### 2.2 Implement Core Infrastructure Create shared utilities: - API client with authentication - Error handling helpers - Response formatting (JSON/Markdown) - Pagination support #### 2.3 Implement Tools For each tool: **Input Schema:** - Use Zod (TypeScript) or Pydantic (Python) - Include constraints and clear descriptions - Add examples in field descriptions **Output Schema:** - Define outputSchema where possible for structured data - Use structuredContent in tool responses (TypeScript SDK feature) - Helps clients understand and process tool outputs **Tool Description:** - Concise summary of functionality - Parameter descriptions - Return type schema **Implementation:** - Async/await for I/O operations - Proper error handling with actionable messages - Support pagination where applicable - Return both text content and structured data when using modern SDKs **Annotations:** - readOnlyHint: true/false - destructiveHint: true/false - idempotentHint: true/false - openWorldHint: true/false --- ### Phase 3: Review and Test #### 3.1 Code Quality Review for: - No duplicated code (DRY principle) - Consistent error handling - Full type coverage - Clear tool descriptions #### 3.2 Build and Test **TypeScript:** - Run npm run build to verify compilation - Test with MCP Inspector: npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector **Python:** - Verify syntax: python -m py_compile your_server.py - Test with MCP Inspector See language-specific guides for detailed testing approaches and quality checklists. --- ### Phase 4: Create Evaluations After implementing your MCP server, create comprehensive evaluations to test its effectiveness. **Load [\u2705 Evaluation Guide](./reference/evaluation.md) for complete evaluation guidelines.** #### 4.1 Understand Evaluation Purpose Use evaluations to test whether LLMs can effectively use your MCP server to answer realistic, complex questions. #### 4.2 Create 10 Evaluation Questions To create effective evaluations, follow the process outlined in the evaluation guide: 1. **Tool Inspection**: List available tools and understand their capabilities 2. **Content Exploration**: Use READ-ONLY operations to explore available data 3. **Question Generation**: Create 10 complex, realistic questions 4. **Answer Verification**: Solve each question yourself to verify answers #### 4.3 Evaluation Requirements Ensure each question is: - **Independent**: Not dependent on other questions - **Read-only**: Only non-destructive operations required - **Complex**: Requiring multiple tool calls and deep exploration - **Realistic**: Based on real use cases humans would care about - **Verifiable**: Single, clear answer that can be verified by string comparison - **Stable**: Answer won't change over time #### 4.4 Output Format Create an XML file with this structure: --- # Reference Files ## \ud83d\udcda Documentation Library Load these resources as needed during development: ### Core MCP Documentation (Load First) -

{"id": "skill_reference_evaluation", "text": "# MCP Server Evaluation Guide ## Overview This document provides guidance on creating comprehensive evaluations for MCP servers. Evaluations test whether LLMs can effectively use your MCP server to answer realistic, complex questions using only the tools provided. --- ## Quick Reference ### Evaluation Requirements - Create 10 human-readable questions - Questions must be READ-ONLY, INDEPENDENT, NON-DESTRUCTIVE - Each question requires multiple tool calls (potentially dozens) - Answers must be single, verifiable values - Answers must be STABLE (won't change over time) ### Output Format --- ## Purpose of Evaluations The measure of quality of an MCP server is NOT how well or comprehensively the server implements tools, but how well these implementations (input/output schemas, docstrings/descriptions, functionality) enable LLMs with no other context and access ONLY to the MCP servers to answer realistic and difficult questions. ## Evaluation Overview Create 10 human-readable questions requiring ONLY READ-ONLY, INDEPENDENT, NON-DESTRUCTIVE, and IDEMPOTENT operations to answer. Each question should be: - Realistic - Clear and concise - Unambiguous - Complex, requiring potentially dozens of tool calls or steps - Answerable with a single, verifiable value that you identify in advance ## Question Guidelines ### Core Requirements 1. **Questions MUST be independent** - Each question should NOT depend on the answer to any other question - Should not assume prior write operations from processing another question 2. **Questions MUST require ONLY NON-DESTRUCTIVE AND IDEMPOTENT tool use** - Should not instruct or require modifying state to arrive at the correct answer 3. **Questions must be REALISTIC, CLEAR, CONCISE, and COMPLEX** - Must require another LLM to use multiple (potentially dozens of) tools or steps to answer ### Complexity and Depth 4. **Questions must require deep exploration** - Consider multi-hop questions requiring multiple sub-questions and sequential tool calls - Each step should benefit from information found in previous questions 5. **Questions may require extensive paging** - May need paging through multiple pages of results - May require querying old data (1-2 years out-of-date) to find niche information - The questions must be DIFFICULT 6. **Questions must require deep understanding** - Rather than surface-level knowledge - May pose complex ideas as True/False questions requiring evidence - May use multiple-choice format where LLM must search different hypotheses 7. **Questions must not be solvable with straightforward keyword search** - Do not include specific keywords from the target content - Use synonyms, related concepts, or paraphrases - Require multiple searches, analyzing multiple related items, extracting context, then deriving the answer ### Tool Testing 8. **Questions should stress-test tool return values** - May elicit tools returning large JSON objects or lists, overwhelming the LLM - Should require understanding multiple modalities of data: - IDs and names - Timestamps and datetimes (months, days, years, seconds) - File IDs, names, extensions, and mimetypes - URLs, GIDs, etc. - Should probe the tool's ability to return all useful forms of data 9. **Questions should MOSTLY reflect real human use cases** - The kinds of information retrieval tasks that HUMANS assisted by an LLM would care about 10. **Questions may require dozens of tool calls** - This challenges LLMs with limited context - Encourages MCP server tools to reduce information returned 11. **Include ambiguous questions** - May be ambiguous OR require difficult decisions on which tools to call - Force the LLM to potentially make mistakes or misinterpret - Ensure that despite AMBIGUITY, there is STILL A SINGLE VERIFIABLE ANSWER ### Stability 12. **Questions must be designed so the answer DOES NOT CHANGE** - Do not ask questions that rely on \"current state\" which is dynamic - For example, do not count: - Number of reactions to a post - Number of replies to a thread - Number of members in a channel 13. **DO NOT let the MCP server RESTRICT the kinds of questions you create** - Create challenging and complex questions - Some may not be solvable with the available MCP server tools - Questions may require specific output formats (datetime vs. epoch time, JSON vs. MARKDOWN) - Questions may require dozens of tool calls to complete ## Answer Guidelines ### Verification 1. **Answers must be VERIFIABLE via direct string comparison** - If the answer can be re-written in many formats, clearly specify the output format in the QUESTION - Examples: \"Use YYYY/MM/DD.\", \"Respond True or False.\", \"Answer A, B, C, or D and nothing else.\" - Answer should be a single VERIFIABLE value such as: - User ID, user name, display name, first name, last name - Channel ID, channel name - Message ID, string - URL, title - Numerical quantity - Timestamp, datetime - Boolean (for True/False questions) - Email address, phone number - File ID, file name, file extension - Multiple choice answer - Answers must not require special formatting or complex, structured output - Answer will be verified using DIRECT STRING COMPARISON ### Readability 2. **Answers should generally prefer HUMAN-READABLE formats** - Examples: names, first name, last name, datetime, file name, message string, URL, yes/no, true/false, a/b/c/d - Rather than opaque IDs (though IDs are acceptable) - The VAST MAJORITY of answers should be human-readable ### Stability 3. **Answers must be STABLE/STATIONARY** - Look at old content (e.g., conversations that have ended, projects that have launched, questions answered) - Create QUESTIONS based on \"closed\" concepts that will always return the same answer - Questions may ask to consider a fixed time window to insulate from non-stationary answers - Rely on context UNLIKELY to change - Example: if finding a paper name, be SPECIFIC enough so answer is not confused with papers published later 4. **Answers must be CLEAR and UNAMBIGUOUS** - Questions must be designed so there is a single, clear answer - Answer can be derived from using the MCP server tools ### Diversity 5. **Answers must be DIVERSE** - Answer should be a single VERIFIABLE value in diverse modalities and formats - User concept: user ID, user name, display name, first name, last name, email address, phone number - Channel concept: channel ID, channel name, channel topic - Message concept: message ID, message string, timestamp, month, day, year 6. **Answers must NOT be complex structures** - Not a list of values - Not a complex object - Not a list of IDs or strings - Not natural language text - UNLESS the answer can be straightforwardly verified using DIRECT STRING COMPARISON - And can be realistically reproduced - It should be unlikely that an LLM would return the same list in any other order or format ## Evaluation Process ### Step 1: Documentation Inspection Read the documentation of the target API to understand: - Available endpoints and functionality - If ambiguity exists, fetch additional information from the web - Parallelize this step AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE - Ensure each subagent is ONLY examining documentation from the file system or on the web ### Step 2: Tool Inspection List the tools available in the MCP server: - Inspect the MCP server directly - Understand input/output schemas, docstrings, and descriptions - WITHOUT calling the tools themselves at this stage ### Step 3: Developing Understanding Repeat steps 1 & 2 until you have a good understanding: - Iterate multiple times - Think about the kinds of tasks you want to create - Refine your understanding - At NO stage should you READ the code of the MCP server implementation itself - Use your intuition and understanding to create reasonable, realistic, but VERY challenging tasks ### Step 4: Read-Only Content Inspection After understanding the API and tools, USE the MCP server tools: - Inspect content using READ-ONLY and NON-DESTRUCTIVE operations ONLY - Goal: identify specific content (e.g., users, channels, messages, projects, tasks) for creating realistic questions - Should NOT call any tools that modify state - Will NOT read the code of the MCP server implementation itself - Parallelize this step with individual sub-agents pursuing independent explorations - Ensure each subagent is only performing READ-ONLY, NON-DESTRUCTIVE, and IDEMPOTENT operations - BE CAREFUL: SOME TOOLS may return LOTS OF DATA which would cause you to run out of CONTEXT - Make INCREMENTAL, SMALL, AND TARGETED tool calls for exploration - In all tool call requests, use the limit parameter to limit results (<10) - Use pagination ### Step 5: Task Generation After inspecting the content, create 10 human-readable questions: - An LLM should be able to answer these with the MCP server - Follow all question and answer guidelines above ## Output Format Each QA pair consists of a question and an answer. The output should be an XML file with this structure: ## Evaluation Examples ### Good Questions **Example 1: Multi-hop question requiring deep exploration (GitHub MCP)** This question is good because: - Requires multiple searches to find archived repositories - Needs to identify which had the most forks before archival - Requires examining repository details for the language - Answer is a simple, verifiable value - Based on historical (closed) data that won't change **Example 2: Requires understanding context without keyword matching (Project Management MCP)** This question is good because: - Doesn't use specific project name (\"initiative focused on improving customer onboarding\") - Requires finding completed projects from specific timeframe - Needs to identify the project lead and their role - Requires understanding context from retrospective documents - Answer is human-readable and stable - Based on completed work (won't change) **Example 3: Complex aggregation requiring multiple steps (Issue Tracker MCP)** This question is good because: - Requires filtering bugs by date, priority, and status - Needs to group by assignee and calculate resolution rates - Requires understanding timestamps to determine 48-hour windows - Tests pagination (potentially many bugs to process) - Answer is a single username - Based on historical data from specific time period **Example 4: Requires synthesis across multiple data types (CRM MCP)** This question is good because: - Requires understanding subscription tier changes - Needs to identify upgrade events in specific timeframe - Requires comparing contract values - Must access account industry information - Answer is simple and verifiable - Based on completed historical transactions ### Poor Questions **Example 1: Answer changes over time** This question is poor because: - The answer will change as issues are created, closed, or reassigned - Not based on stable/stationary data - Relies on \"current state\" which is dynamic **Example 2: Too easy with keyword search** This question is poor because: - Can be solved with a straightforward keyword search for exact title - Doesn't require deep exploration or understanding - No synthesis or analysis needed **Example 3: Ambiguous answer format** This question is poor because: - Answer is a list that could be returned in any order - Difficult to verify with direct string comparison - LLM might format differently (JSON array, comma-separated, newline-separated) - Better to ask for a specific aggregate (count) or superlative (most stars) ## Verification Process After creating evaluations: 1. **Examine the XML file** to understand the schema 2. **Load each task instruction** and in parallel using the MCP server and tools, identify the correct answer by attempting to solve the task YOURSELF 3. **Flag any operations** that require WRITE or DESTRUCTIVE operations 4. **Accumulate all CORRECT answers** and replace any incorrect answers in the document 5. **Remove any <qa_pair>** that require WRITE or DESTRUCTIVE operations Remember to parallelize solving tasks to avoid running out of context, then accumulate all answers and make changes to the file at the end. ## Tips for Creating Quality Evaluations 1. **Think Hard and Plan Ahead** before generating tasks 2. **Parallelize Where Opportunity Arises** to speed up the process and manage context 3. **Focus on Realistic Use Cases** that humans would actually want to accomplish 4. **Create Challenging Questions** that test the limits of the MCP server's capabilities 5. **Ensure Stability** by using historical data and closed concepts 6. **Verify Answers** by solving the questions yourself using the MCP server tools 7. **Iterate and Refine** based on what you learn during the process --- # Running Evaluations After creating your evaluation file, you can use the provided evaluation harness to test your MCP server. ## Setup 1. **Install Dependencies** Or install manually: 2. **Set API Key** ## Evaluation File Format Evaluation files use XML format with <qa_pair> elements: ## Running Evaluations The evaluation script (scripts/evaluation.py) supports three transport types: **Important:** - **stdio transport**: The evaluation script automatically launches and manages the MCP server process for you. Do not run the server manually. - **sse/http transports**: You must start the MCP server separately before running the evaluation. The script connects to the already-running server at the specified URL. ### 1.

{"id": "skill_reference_mcp_best_practices", "text": "# MCP Server Best Practices ## Quick Reference ### Server Naming - **Python**: {service}_mcp (e.g., slack_mcp) - **Node/TypeScript**: {service}-mcp-server (e.g., slack-mcp-server) ### Tool Naming - Use snake_case with service prefix - Format: {service}_{action}_{resource} - Example: slack_send_message, github_create_issue ### Response Formats - Support both JSON and Markdown formats - JSON for programmatic processing - Markdown for human readability ### Pagination - Always respect limit parameter - Return has_more, next_offset, total_count - Default to 20-50 items ### Transport - **Streamable HTTP**: For remote servers, multi-client scenarios - **stdio**: For local integrations, command-line tools - Avoid SSE (deprecated in favor of streamable HTTP) --- ## Server Naming Conventions Follow these standardized naming patterns: **Python**: Use format {service}_mcp (lowercase with underscores) - Examples: slack_mcp, github_mcp, jira_mcp **Node/TypeScript**: Use format {service}-mcp-server (lowercase with hyphens) - Examples: slack-mcp-server, github-mcp-server, jira-mcp-server The name should be general, descriptive of the service being integrated, easy to infer from the task description, and without version numbers. --- ## Tool Naming and Design ### Tool Naming 1. **Use snake_case**: search_users, create_project, get_channel_info 2. **Include service prefix**: Anticipate that your MCP server may be used alongside other MCP servers - Use slack_send_message instead of just send_message - Use github_create_issue instead of just create_issue 3. **Be action-oriented**: Start with verbs (get, list, search, create, etc.) 4. **Be specific**: Avoid generic names that could conflict with other servers ### Tool Design - Tool descriptions must narrowly and unambiguously describe functionality - Descriptions must precisely match actual functionality - Provide tool annotations (readOnlyHint, destructiveHint, idempotentHint, openWorldHint) - Keep tool operations focused and atomic --- ## Response Formats All tools that return data should support multiple formats: ### JSON Format (response_format=\"json\") - Machine-readable structured data - Include all available fields and metadata - Consistent field names and types - Use for programmatic processing ### Markdown Format (response_format=\"markdown\", typically default) - Human-readable formatted text - Use headers, lists, and formatting for clarity - Convert timestamps to human-readable format - Show display names with IDs in parentheses - Omit verbose metadata --- ## Pagination For tools that list resources: - **Always respect the limit parameter** - **Implement pagination**: Use offset or cursor-based pagination - **Return pagination metadata**: Include has_more, next_offset/next_cursor, total_count - **Never load all results into memory**: Especially important for large datasets - **Default to reasonable limits**: 20-50 items is typical Example pagination response: --- ## Transport Options ### Streamable HTTP **Best for**: Remote servers, web services, multi-client scenarios **Characteristics**: - Bidirectional communication over HTTP - Supports multiple simultaneous clients - Can be deployed as a web service - Enables server-to-client notifications **Use when**: - Serving multiple clients simultaneously - Deploying as a cloud service - Integration with web applications ### stdio **Best for**: Local integrations, command-line tools **Characteristics**: - Standard input/output stream communication - Simple setup, no network configuration needed - Runs as a subprocess of the client **Use when**: - Building tools for local development environments - Integrating with desktop applications - Single-user, single-session scenarios **Note**: stdio servers should NOT log to stdout (use stderr for logging) ### Transport Selection | Criterion | stdio | Streamable HTTP | |-----------|-------|-----------------| | **Deployment** | Local | Remote | | **Clients** | Single | Multiple | | **Complexity** | Low | Medium | | **Real-time** | No | Yes | --- ## Security Best Practices ### Authentication and Authorization **OAuth 2.1**: - Use secure OAuth 2.1 with certificates from recognized authorities - Validate access tokens before processing requests - Only accept tokens specifically intended for your server **API Keys**: - Store API keys in environment variables, never in code - Validate keys on server startup - Provide clear error messages when authentication fails ### Input Validation - Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal - Validate URLs and external identifiers - Check parameter sizes and ranges - Prevent command injection in system calls - Use schema validation (Pydantic/Zod) for all inputs ### Error Handling - Don't expose internal errors to clients - Log security-relevant errors server-side - Provide helpful but not revealing error messages - Clean up resources after errors ### DNS Rebinding Protection For streamable HTTP servers running locally: - Enable DNS rebinding protection - Validate the Origin header on all incoming connections - Bind to 127.0.0.1 rather than 0.0.0.0 --- ## Tool Annotations Provide annotations to help clients understand tool behavior: | Annotation | Type | Default | Description | |-----------|------|---------|-------------| | readOnlyHint | boolean | false | Tool does not modify its environment | | destructiveHint | boolean | true | Tool may perform destructive updates | | idempotentHint | boolean | false | Repeated calls with same args have no additional effect | | openWorldHint | boolean | true | Tool interacts with external entities | **Important**: Annotations are hints, not security guarantees. Clients should not make security-critical decisions based solely on annotations. --- ## Error Handling - Use standard JSON-RPC error codes - Report tool errors within result objects (not protocol-level errors) - Provide helpful, specific error messages with suggested next steps - Don't expose internal implementation details - Clean up resources properly on errors Example error handling: --- ## Testing Requirements Comprehensive testing should cover: - **Functional testing**: Verify correct execution with valid/invalid inputs - **Integration testing**: Test interaction with external systems - **Security testing**: Validate auth, input sanitization, rate limiting - **Performance testing**: Check behavior under load, timeouts - **Error handling**: Ensure proper error reporting and cleanup --- ## Documentation Requirements - Provide clear documentation of all tools and capabilities - Include working examples (at least 3 per major feature) - Document security considerations - Specify required permissions and access levels - Document rate limits and performance characteristics", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "reference", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\mcp-builder\\reference\\mcp_best_practices.md", "title": "mcp_best_practices"}}
{"id": "skill_reference_node_mcp_server", "text": "# Node/TypeScript MCP Server Implementation Guide ## Overview This document provides Node/TypeScript-specific best practices and examples for implementing MCP servers using the MCP TypeScript SDK. It covers project structure, server setup, tool registration patterns, input validation with Zod, error handling, and complete working examples. --- ## Quick Reference ### Key Imports ### Server Initialization ### Tool Registration Pattern --- ## MCP TypeScript SDK The official MCP TypeScript SDK provides: - McpServer class for server initialization - registerTool method for tool registration - Zod schema integration for runtime input validation - Type-safe tool handler implementations **IMPORTANT - Use Modern APIs Only:** - **DO use**: server.registerTool(), server.registerResource(), server.registerPrompt() - **DO NOT use**: Old deprecated APIs such as server.tool(), server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, ...), or manual handler registration - The register* methods provide better type safety, automatic schema handling, and are the recommended approach See the MCP SDK documentation in the references for complete details. ## Server Naming Convention Node/TypeScript MCP servers must follow this naming pattern: - **Format**: {service}-mcp-server (lowercase with hyphens) - **Examples**: github-mcp-server, jira-mcp-server, stripe-mcp-server The name should be: - General (not tied to specific features) - Descriptive of the service/API being integrated - Easy to infer from the task description - Without version numbers or dates ## Project Structure Create the following structure for Node/TypeScript MCP servers: ## Tool Implementation ### Tool Naming Use snake_case for tool names (e.g., \"search_users\", \"create_project\", \"get_channel_info\") with clear, action-oriented names. **Avoid Naming Conflicts**: Include the service context to prevent overlaps: - Use \"slack_send_message\" instead of just \"send_message\" - Use \"github_create_issue\" instead of just \"create_issue\" - Use \"asana_list_tasks\" instead of just \"list_tasks\" ### Tool Structure Tools are registered using the registerTool method with the following requirements: - Use Zod schemas for runtime input validation and type safety - The description field must be explicitly provided - JSDoc comments are NOT automatically extracted - Explicitly provide title, description, inputSchema, and annotations - The inputSchema must be a Zod schema object (not a JSON schema) - Type all parameters and return values explicitly ## Zod Schemas for Input Validation Zod provides runtime type validation: ## Response Format Options Support multiple output formats for flexibility: **Markdown format**: - Use headers, lists, and formatting for clarity - Convert timestamps to human-readable format - Show display names with IDs in parentheses - Omit verbose metadata - Group related information logically **JSON format**: - Return complete, structured data suitable for programmatic processing - Include all available fields and metadata - Use consistent field names and types ## Pagination Implementation For tools that list resources: ## Character Limits and Truncation Add a CHARACTER_LIMIT constant to prevent overwhelming responses: ## Error Handling Provide clear, actionable error messages: ## Shared Utilities Extract common functionality into reusable functions: ## Async/Await Best Practices Always use async/await for network requests and I/O operations: ## TypeScript Best Practices 1. **Use Strict TypeScript**: Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json 2. **Define Interfaces**: Create clear interface definitions for all data structures 3. **Avoid any**: Use proper types or unknown instead of any 4. **Zod for Runtime Validation**: Use Zod schemas to validate external data 5. **Type Guards**: Create type guard functions for complex type checking 6. **Error Handling**: Always use try-catch with proper error type checking 7. **Null Safety**: Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) ## Package Configuration ### package.json ### tsconfig.json ## Complete Example --- ## Advanced MCP Features ### Resource Registration Expose data as resources for efficient, URI-based access: **When to use Resources vs Tools:** - **Resources**: For data access with simple URI-based parameters - **Tools**: For complex operations requiring validation and business logic - **Resources**: When data is relatively static or template-based - **Tools**: When operations have side effects or complex workflows ### Transport Options The TypeScript SDK supports two main transport mechanisms: #### Streamable HTTP (Recommended for Remote Servers) #### stdio (For Local Integrations) **Transport selection:** - **Streamable HTTP**: Web services, remote access, multiple clients - **stdio**: Command-line tools, local development, subprocess integration ### Notification Support Notify clients when server state changes: Use notifications sparingly - only when server capabilities genuinely change. --- ## Code Best Practices ### Code Composability and Reusability Your implementation MUST prioritize composability and code reuse: 1. **Extract Common Functionality**: - Create reusable helper functions for operations used across multiple tools - Build shared API clients for HTTP requests instead of duplicating code - Centralize error handling logic in utility functions - Extract business logic into dedicated functions that can be composed - Extract shared markdown or JSON field selection & formatting functionality 2. **Avoid Duplication**: - NEVER copy-paste similar code between tools - If you find yourself writing similar logic twice, extract it into a function - Common operations like pagination, filtering, field selection, and formatting should be shared - Authentication/authorization logic should be centralized ## Building and Running Always build your TypeScript code before running: Always ensure npm run build completes successfully before considering the implementation complete. ## Quality Checklist Before finalizing your Node/TypeScript MCP server implementation, ensure: ### Strategic Design -

{"id": "skill_moodleexternalapidevelopment_skill", "text": "--- name: moodle-external-api-development description: Create custom external web service APIs for Moodle LMS. Use when implementing web services for course management, user tracking, quiz operations, or custom plugin functionality. Covers parameter validation, database operations, error handling, service registration, and Moodle coding standards. --- # Moodle External API Development This skill guides you through creating custom external web service APIs for Moodle LMS, following Moodle's external API framework and coding standards. ## When to Use This Skill - Creating custom web services for Moodle plugins - Implementing REST/AJAX endpoints for course management - Building APIs for quiz operations, user tracking, or reporting - Exposing Moodle functionality to external applications - Developing mobile app backends using Moodle ## Core Architecture Pattern Moodle external APIs follow a strict three-method pattern: 1. **execute_parameters()** - Defines input parameter structure 2. **execute()** - Contains business logic 3. **execute_returns()** - Defines return structure ## Step-by-Step Implementation ### Step 1: Create the External API Class File **Location**: /local/yourplugin/classes/external/your_api_name.php **Key Points**: - Class must extend external_api - Namespace follows: local_pluginname\\external or mod_modname\\external - Include the security check: defined('MOODLE_INTERNAL') || die(); - Require externallib.php for base classes ### Step 2: Define Input Parameters **Common Parameter Types**: - PARAM_INT - Integers - PARAM_TEXT - Plain text (HTML stripped) - PARAM_RAW - Raw text (no cleaning) - PARAM_BOOL - Boolean values - PARAM_FLOAT - Floating point numbers - PARAM_ALPHANUMEXT - Alphanumeric with extended chars **Structures**: - external_value - Single value - external_single_structure - Object with named fields - external_multiple_structure - Array of items **Value Flags**: - VALUE_REQUIRED - Parameter must be provided - VALUE_OPTIONAL - Parameter is optional - VALUE_DEFAULT, defaultvalue - Optional with default ### Step 3: Implement Business Logic **Critical Steps**: 1. **Always validate parameters** using validate_parameters() 2. **Check context** using validate_context() 3. **Verify capabilities** using require_capability() 4. **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection 5. **Return structured data** matching return definition ### Step 4: Define Return Structure **Return Structure Rules**: - Must match exactly what execute() returns - Use appropriate parameter types - Document each field with description - Nested structures allowed ### Step 5: Register the Service **Location**: /local/yourplugin/db/services.php **Service Registration Keys**: - classname - Full namespaced class name - methodname - Always 'execute' - type - 'read' (SELECT) or 'write' (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) - ajax - Set true for AJAX/REST access - capabilities - Required Moodle capabilities - services - Optional service bundles ### Step 6: Implement Error Handling & Logging **Error Handling Best Practices**: - Wrap logic in try-catch blocks - Log errors with timestamps and context - Capture SQL queries on database errors - Preserve stack traces for debugging - Re-throw exceptions after logging ## Advanced Patterns ### Complex Database Operations ### Working with Course Modules ### Access Restrictions (Groups/Availability) ### Random Question Selection with Tags ## Testing Your API ### 1. Via Moodle Web Services Test Client 1. Enable web services: **Site administration > Advanced features** 2. Enable REST protocol: **Site administration > Plugins > Web services > Manage protocols** 3. Create service: **Site administration > Server > Web services > External services** 4. Test function: **Site administration > Development > Web service test client** ### 2. Via curl ### 3. Via JavaScript (AJAX) ## Common Pitfalls & Solutions ### 1. \"Function not found\" Error **Solution**: - Purge caches: **Site administration > Development > Purge all caches** - Verify function name in services.php matches exactly - Check namespace and class name are correct ### 2. \"Invalid parameter value detected\" **Solution**: - Ensure parameter types match between definition and usage - Check required vs optional parameters - Validate nested structure definitions ### 3. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities **Solution**: - Always use placeholder parameters (:paramname) - Never concatenate user input into SQL strings - Use Moodle's database methods: get_record(), get_records(), etc. ### 4. Permission Denied Errors **Solution**: - Call self::validate_context($context) early in execute() - Check required capabilities match user's permissions - Verify user has role assignments in the context ### 5. Transaction Deadlocks **Solution**: - Keep transactions short - Always commit or rollback in finally blocks - Avoid nested transactions ## Debugging Checklist - [ ] Check Moodle debug mode: **Site administration > Development > Debugging** - [ ] Review web services logs: **Site administration > Reports > Logs** - [ ] Check custom log files in $CFG->dataroot/local_yourplugin/ - [ ] Verify database queries using $DB->set_debug(true) - [ ] Test with admin user to rule out permission issues - [ ] Clear browser cache and Moodle caches - [ ] Check PHP error logs on server ## Plugin Structure Checklist ## Examples from Real Implementation ### Simple Read API (Get Quiz Attempts) ### Complex Write API (Create Quiz from Categories) See attached create_quiz_from_categories.php for a comprehensive example including: - Multiple database insertions - Course module creation - Quiz instance configuration - Random question selection with tags - Group-based access restrictions - Extensive error logging - Transaction management ## Quick Reference: Common Moodle Tables | Table | Purpose | |-------|---------| | {user} | User accounts | | {course} | Courses | | {course_modules} | Activity instances in courses | | {modules} | Available activity types (quiz, forum, etc.) | | {quiz} | Quiz configurations | | {quiz_attempts} | Quiz attempt records | | {question} | Question bank | | {question_categories} | Question categories | | {grade_items} | Gradebook items | | {grade_grades} | Student grades | | {groups} | Course groups | | {groups_members} | Group memberships | | {logstore_standard_log} | Activity logs | ## Additional Resources - [Moodle External API Documentation](https://moodledev.io/docs/5.2/apis/subsystems/external/functions) - [Moodle Coding Style](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/codingstyle) - [Moodle Database API](https://moodledev.io/docs/5.2/apis/core/dml) - [Web Services API Documentation](https://moodledev.io/docs/5.2/apis/subsystems/external) ## Guidelines - Always validate input parameters using validate_parameters() - Check user context and capabilities before operations - Use parameterized SQL queries (never string concatenation) - Implement comprehensive error handling and logging - Follow Moodle naming conventions (lowercase, underscores) - Document all parameters and return values clearly - Test with different user roles and permissions - Consider transaction safety for write operations - Purge caches after service registration changes - Keep API methods focused and single-purpose", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "moodle-external-api-development", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\moodle-external-api-development\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

Use two connection strings: - DATABASE_URL: Pooled connection for Prisma Client - DIRECT_URL: Direct connection for Prisma Migrate The pooled connection uses PgBouncer for up to 10K connections. Direct connection required for migrations (DDL operations). ### Drizzle with Neon Serverless Driver Use Drizzle ORM with Neon's serverless HTTP driver for edge/serverless environments. Two driver options: - neon-http: Single queries over HTTP (fastest for one-off queries) - neon-serverless: WebSocket for transactions and sessions ### Connection Pooling with PgBouncer Neon provides built-in connection pooling via PgBouncer. Key limits: - Up to 10,000 concurrent connections to pooler - Connections still consume underlying Postgres connections - 7 connections reserved for Neon superuser Use pooled endpoint for application, direct for migrations. ## \u26a0\ufe0f Sharp Edges | Issue | Severity | Solution | |-------|----------|----------| | Issue | high | See docs | | Issue | high | See docs | | Issue | high | See docs | | Issue | medium | See docs | | Issue | medium | See docs | | Issue | low | See docs | | Issue | medium | See docs | | Issue | high | See docs |", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "neon-postgres", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\neon-postgres\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

Framework Selection (2025) ### Decision Tree ### Comparison Principles | Factor | Hono | Fastify | Express | |--------|------|---------|---------| | **Best for** | Edge, serverless | Performance | Legacy, learning | | **Cold start** | Fastest | Fast | Moderate | | **Ecosystem** | Growing | Good | Largest | | **TypeScript** | Native | Excellent | Good | | **Learning curve** | Low | Medium | Low | ### Selection Questions to Ask: 1. What's the deployment target? 2. Is cold start time critical? 3. Does team have existing experience? 4. Is there legacy code to maintain? --- ## 2. Runtime Considerations (2025) ### Native TypeScript ### Module System Decision ### Runtime Selection | Runtime | Best For | |---------|----------| | **Node.js** | General purpose, largest ecosystem | | **Bun** | Performance, built-in bundler | | **Deno** | Security-first, built-in TypeScript | --- ## 3. Architecture Principles ### Layered Structure Concept ### Why This Matters: - **Testability**: Mock layers independently - **Flexibility**: Swap database without touching business logic - **Clarity**: Each layer has single responsibility ### When to Simplify: - Small scripts \u2192 Single file OK - Prototypes \u2192 Less structure acceptable - Always ask: \"Will this grow?\" --- ## 4. Error Handling Principles ### Centralized Error Handling ### Error Response Philosophy ### Status Code Selection | Situation | Status | When | |-----------|--------|------| | Bad input | 400 | Client sent invalid data | | No auth | 401 | Missing or invalid credentials | | No permission | 403 | Valid auth, but not allowed | | Not found | 404 | Resource doesn't exist | | Conflict | 409 | Duplicate or state conflict | | Validation | 422 | Schema valid but business rules fail | | Server error | 500 | Our fault, log everything | --- ## 5.

Security Principles ### Security Checklist (Not Code) - [ ] **Input validation**: All inputs validated - [ ] **Parameterized queries**: No string concatenation for SQL - [ ] **Password hashing**: bcrypt or argon2 - [ ] **JWT verification**: Always verify signature and expiry - [ ] **Rate limiting**: Protect from abuse - [ ] **Security headers**: Helmet.js or equivalent - [ ] **HTTPS**: Everywhere in production - [ ] **CORS**: Properly configured - [ ] **Secrets**: Environment variables only - [ ] **Dependencies**: Regularly audited ### Security Mindset --- ## 8. Testing Principles ### Test Strategy Selection | Type | Purpose | Tools | |------|---------|-------| | **Unit** | Business logic | node:test, Vitest | | **Integration** | API endpoints | Supertest | | **E2E** | Full flows | Playwright | ### What to Test (Priorities) 1. **Critical paths**: Auth, payments, core business 2. **Edge cases**: Empty inputs, boundaries 3. **Error handling**: What happens when things fail? 4. **Not worth testing**: Framework code, trivial getters ### Built-in Test Runner (Node.js 22+) --- ## 10. Anti-Patterns to Avoid ### \u274c DON'T: - Use Express for new edge projects (use Hono) - Use sync methods in production code - Put business logic in controllers - Skip input validation - Hardcode secrets - Trust external data without validation - Block event loop with CPU work ### \u2705 DO: - Choose framework based on context - Ask user for preferences when unclear - Use layered architecture for growing projects - Validate all inputs - Use environment variables for secrets - Profile before optimizing --- ## 11. Decision Checklist Before implementing: - [ ] **Asked user about stack preference?** - [ ] **Chosen framework for THIS context?** (not just default) - [ ] **Considered deployment target?** - [ ] **Planned error handling strategy?** - [ ] **Identified validation points?** - [ ] **Considered security requirements?** --- > **Remember**: Node.js best practices are about decision-making, not memorizing patterns.

{"id": "skill_notebooklm_authentication", "text": "# Authentication Architecture ## Overview This skill uses a **hybrid authentication approach** that combines the best of both worlds: 1. **Persistent Browser Profile** (user_data_dir) for consistent browser fingerprinting 2. **Manual Cookie Injection** from state.json for reliable session cookie persistence ## Why This Approach? ### The Problem Playwright/Patchright has a known bug ([#36139](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/36139)) where **session cookies** (cookies without an Expires attribute) do not persist correctly when using launch_persistent_context() with user_data_dir. **What happens:** - \u2705 Persistent cookies (with Expires date) \u2192 Saved correctly to browser profile - \u274c Session cookies (without Expires) \u2192 **Lost after browser restarts** **Impact:** - Some Google auth cookies are session cookies - Users experience random authentication failures - \"Works on my machine\" syndrome (depends on which cookies Google uses) ### TypeScript vs Python The **MCP Server** (TypeScript) can work around this by passing storage_state as a parameter: But **Python's Playwright API doesn't support this** ([#14949](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/14949)): ## Our Solution: Hybrid Approach We use a **two-phase authentication system**: ### Phase 1: Setup (auth_manager.py setup) 1. Launch persistent context with user_data_dir 2. User logs in manually 3. **Save state to TWO places:** - Browser profile directory (automatic, for fingerprint + persistent cookies) - state.json file (explicit save, for session cookies) ### Phase 2: Runtime (ask_question.py) 1. Launch persistent context with user_data_dir (loads fingerprint + persistent cookies) 2. **Manually inject cookies** from state.json (adds session cookies) ## Benefits | Feature | Our Approach | Pure user_data_dir | Pure storage_state | |---------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------| | **Browser Fingerprint Consistency** | \u2705 Same across restarts | \u2705 Same | \u274c Changes each time | | **Session Cookie Persistence** | \u2705 Manual injection | \u274c Lost (bug) | \u2705 Native support | | **Persistent Cookie Persistence** | \u2705 Automatic | \u2705 Automatic | \u2705 Native support | | **Google Trust** | \u2705 High (same browser) | \u2705 High | \u274c Low (new browser) | | **Cross-platform Reliability** | \u2705 Chrome required | \u26a0\ufe0f Chromium issues | \u2705 Portable | | **Cache Performance** | \u2705 Keeps cache | \u2705 Keeps cache | \u274c No cache | ## File Structure ## Why state.json is Critical Even though we use user_data_dir, we **still need state.json** because: 1. **Session cookies** are not saved to the browser profile (Playwright bug) 2. **Manual injection** is the only reliable way to load session cookies 3. **Validation** - we can check if cookies are expired before launching ## Code References **Setup:** scripts/auth_manager.py:94-120 - Lines 100-113: Launch persistent context with channel=\"chrome\" - Line 167: Save to state.json via context.storage_state() **Runtime:** scripts/ask_question.py:77-118 - Lines 86-99: Launch persistent context - Lines 101-118: Manual cookie injection workaround **Validation:** scripts/auth_manager.py:236-298 - Lines 262-275: Launch persistent context - Lines 277-287: Manual cookie injection for validation ## Related Issues - [microsoft/playwright#36139](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/36139) - Session cookies not persisting - [microsoft/playwright#14949](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/14949) - Storage state with persistent context - [StackOverflow Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79641481/) - Session cookie persistence issue ## Future Improvements If Playwright adds support for storage_state parameter in Python's launch_persistent_context(), we can simplify to: Until then, our hybrid approach is the most reliable solution.", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "notebooklm", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\notebooklm\\AUTHENTICATION.md", "title": "AUTHENTICATION"}}

Browser automation, library management, persistent auth. Drastically reduced hallucinations - answers only from your uploaded documents. [Installation](#installation) \u2022 [Quick Start](#quick-start) \u2022 [Why NotebookLM](#why-notebooklm-not-local-rag) \u2022 [How It Works](#how-it-works) \u2022 [MCP Alternative](https://github.com/PleasePrompto/notebooklm-mcp) </div> --- ## \u26a0\ufe0f Important: Local Claude Code Only **This skill works ONLY with local [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) installations, NOT in the web UI.** The web UI runs skills in a sandbox without network access, which this skill requires for browser automation. You must use [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) locally on your machine. --- ## The Problem When you tell [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) to \"search through my local documentation\", here's what happens: - **Massive token consumption**: Searching through documentation means reading multiple files repeatedly - **Inaccurate retrieval**: Searches for keywords, misses context and connections between docs - **Hallucinations**: When it can't find something, it invents plausible-sounding APIs - **Manual copy-paste**: Switching between NotebookLM browser and your editor constantly ## The Solution This Claude Code Skill lets [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) chat directly with [**NotebookLM**](https://notebooklm.google/) \u2014 Google's **source-grounded knowledge base** powered by Gemini 2.5 that provides intelligent, synthesized answers exclusively from your uploaded documents. **No more copy-paste dance**: Claude asks questions directly and gets answers straight back in the CLI. It builds deep understanding through automatic follow-ups, getting specific implementation details, edge cases, and best practices. --- ## Why NotebookLM, Not Local RAG? | Approach | Token Cost | Setup Time | Hallucinations | Answer Quality | |----------|------------|------------|----------------|----------------| | **Feed docs to Claude** | \ud83d\udd34 Very high (multiple file reads) | Instant | Yes - fills gaps | Variable retrieval | | **Web search** | \ud83d\udfe1 Medium | Instant | High - unreliable sources | Hit or miss | | **Local RAG** | \ud83d\udfe1 Medium-High | Hours (embeddings, chunking) | Medium - retrieval gaps | Depends on setup | | **NotebookLM Skill** | \ud83d\udfe2 Minimal | 5 minutes | **Minimal** - source-grounded only | Expert synthesis | ### What Makes NotebookLM Superior? 1. **Pre-processed by Gemini**: Upload docs once, get instant expert knowledge 2. **Natural language Q&A**: Not just retrieval \u2014 actual understanding and synthesis 3. **Multi-source correlation**: Connects information across 50+ documents 4. **Citation-backed**: Every answer includes source references 5. **No infrastructure**: No vector DBs, embeddings, or chunking strategies needed --- ## Installation ### The simplest installation ever: When you first use the skill, it automatically: - Creates an isolated Python environment (.venv) - Installs all dependencies including **Google Chrome** - Sets up browser automation with Chrome (not Chromium) for maximum reliability - Everything stays contained in the skill folder **Note:** The setup uses real Chrome instead of Chromium for cross-platform reliability, consistent browser fingerprinting, and better anti-detection with Google services --- ## Quick Start ### 1. Check your skills Say in Claude Code: Claude will list your available skills including NotebookLM. ### 2. Authenticate with Google (one-time) *A Chrome window opens \u2192 log in with your Google account* ### 3. Create your knowledge base Go to [notebooklm.google.com](https://notebooklm.google.com) \u2192 Create notebook \u2192 Upload your docs: - \ud83d\udcc4 PDFs, Google Docs, markdown files - \ud83d\udd17 Websites, GitHub repos - \ud83c\udfa5 YouTube videos - \ud83d\udcda Multiple sources per notebook Share: **\u2699\ufe0f Share \u2192 Anyone with link \u2192 Copy** ### 4. Add to your library **Option A: Let Claude figure it out (Smart Add)** Claude will automatically query the notebook to discover its content, then add it with appropriate metadata. **Option B: Manual add** Claude will ask for a name and topics, then save it for future use. ### 5. Start researching Claude automatically selects the right notebook and gets the answer directly from NotebookLM. --- ## How It Works This is a **Claude Code Skill** - a local folder containing instructions and scripts that Claude Code can use when needed. Unlike the [MCP server version](https://github.com/PleasePrompto/notebooklm-mcp), this runs directly in Claude Code without needing a separate server. ### Key Differences from MCP Server | Feature | This Skill | MCP Server | |---------|------------|------------| | **Protocol** | Claude Skills | Model Context Protocol | | **Installation** | Clone to ~/.claude/skills | claude mcp add ... | | **Sessions** | Fresh browser each question | Persistent chat sessions | | **Compatibility** | Claude Code only (local) | Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc. | | **Language** | Python | TypeScript | | **Distribution** | Git clone | npm package | ### Architecture When you mention NotebookLM or send a notebook URL, Claude: 1. Loads the skill instructions 2. Runs the appropriate Python script 3. Opens a browser, asks your question 4. Returns the answer directly to you 5. Uses that knowledge to help with your task --- ## Core Features ### **Source-Grounded Responses** NotebookLM significantly reduces hallucinations by answering exclusively from your uploaded documents. If information isn't available, it indicates uncertainty rather than inventing content. ### **Direct Integration** No copy-paste between browser and editor. Claude asks and receives answers programmatically. ### **Smart Library Management** Save NotebookLM links with tags and descriptions. Claude auto-selects the right notebook for your task. ### **Automatic Authentication** One-time Google login, then authentication persists across sessions. ### **Self-Contained** Everything runs in the skill folder with an isolated Python environment. No global installations. ### **Human-Like Automation** Uses realistic typing speeds and interaction patterns to avoid detection. --- ## Common Commands | What you say | What happens | |--------------|--------------| | *\"Set up NotebookLM authentication\"* | Opens Chrome for Google login | | *\"Add [link] to my NotebookLM library\"* | Saves notebook with metadata | | *\"Show my NotebookLM notebooks\"* | Lists all saved notebooks | | *\"Ask my API docs about [topic]\"* | Queries the relevant notebook | | *\"Use the React notebook\"* | Sets active notebook | | *\"Clear NotebookLM data\"* | Fresh start (keeps library) | --- ## Real-World Examples ### Example 1: Workshop Manual Query **User asks**: \"Check my Suzuki GSR 600 workshop manual for brake fluid type, engine oil specs, and rear axle torque.\" **Claude automatically**: - Authenticates with NotebookLM - Asks comprehensive questions about each specification - Follows up when prompted \"Is that ALL you need to know?\" - Provides accurate specifications: DOT 4 brake fluid, SAE 10W-40 oil, 100 N\u00b7m rear axle torque ### Example 2: Building Without Hallucinations **You**: \"I need to build an n8n workflow for Gmail spam filtering. Use my n8n notebook.\" **Claude's internal process:** **Result**: Working workflow on first try, no debugging hallucinated APIs. --- ## Technical Details ### Core Technology - **Patchright**: Browser automation library (Playwright-based) - **Python**: Implementation language for this skill - **Stealth techniques**: Human-like typing and interaction patterns Note: The MCP server uses the same Patchright library but via TypeScript/npm ecosystem. ### Dependencies - **patchright==1.55.2**: Browser automation - **python-dotenv==1.0.0**: Environment configuration - Automatically installed in .venv on first use ### Data Storage All data is stored locally within the skill directory: **Important Security Note:** - The data/ directory contains sensitive authentication data and personal notebooks - It's automatically excluded from git via .gitignore - NEVER manually commit or share the contents of the data/ directory ### Session Model Unlike the MCP server, this skill uses a **stateless model**: - Each question opens a fresh browser - Asks the question, gets the answer - Adds a follow-up prompt to encourage Claude to ask more questions - Closes the browser immediately This means: - No persistent chat context - Each question is independent - But your notebook library persists - **Follow-up mechanism**: Each answer includes \"Is that ALL you need to know?\" to prompt Claude to ask comprehensive follow-ups For multi-step research, Claude automatically asks follow-up questions when needed. --- ## Limitations ### Skill-Specific - **Local Claude Code only** - Does not work in web UI (sandbox restrictions) - **No session persistence** - Each question is independent - **No follow-up context** - Can't reference \"the previous answer\" ### NotebookLM - **Rate limits** - Free tier has daily query limits - **Manual upload** - You must upload docs to NotebookLM first - **Share requirement** - Notebooks must be shared publicly --- ## FAQ **Why doesn't this work in the Claude web UI?** The web UI runs skills in a sandbox without network access. Browser automation requires network access to reach NotebookLM. **How is this different from the MCP server?** This is a simpler, Python-based implementation that runs directly as a Claude Skill. The MCP server is more feature-rich with persistent sessions and works with multiple tools (Codex, Cursor, etc.). **Can I use both this skill and the MCP server?** Yes! They serve different purposes. Use the skill for quick Claude Code integration, use the MCP server for persistent sessions and multi-tool support. **What if Chrome crashes?** Run: \"Clear NotebookLM browser data\" and try again. **Is my Google account secure?** Chrome runs locally on your machine. Your credentials never leave your computer. Use a dedicated Google account if you're concerned. --- ## Troubleshooting ### Skill not found ### Authentication issues Say: \"Reset NotebookLM authentication\" ### Browser crashes Say: \"Clear NotebookLM browser data\" ### Dependencies issues --- ## Disclaimer This tool automates browser interactions with NotebookLM to make your workflow more efficient. However, a few friendly reminders: **About browser automation:** While I've built in humanization features (realistic typing speeds, natural delays, mouse movements) to make the automation behave more naturally, I can't guarantee Google won't detect or flag automated usage. I recommend using a dedicated Google account for automation rather than your primary account\u2014think of it like web scraping: probably fine, but better safe than sorry! **About CLI tools and AI agents:** CLI tools like Claude Code, Codex, and similar AI-powered assistants are incredibly powerful, but they can make mistakes. Please use them with care and awareness: - Always review changes before committing or deploying - Test in safe environments first - Keep backups of important work - Remember: AI agents are assistants, not infallible oracles I built this tool for myself because I was tired of the copy-paste dance between NotebookLM and my editor. I'm sharing it in the hope it helps others too, but I can't take responsibility for any issues, data loss, or account problems that might occur. Use at your own discretion and judgment. That said, if you run into problems or have questions, feel free to open an issue on GitHub. I'm happy to help troubleshoot! --- ## Credits This skill is inspired by my [**NotebookLM MCP Server**](https://github.com/PleasePrompto/notebooklm-mcp) and provides an alternative implementation as a Claude Code Skill: - Both use Patchright for browser automation (TypeScript for MCP, Python for Skill) - Skill version runs directly in Claude Code without MCP protocol - Stateless design optimized for skill architecture If you need: - **Persistent sessions** \u2192 Use the [MCP Server](https://github.com/PleasePrompto/notebooklm-mcp) - **Multiple tool support** (Codex, Cursor) \u2192 Use the [MCP Server](https://github.com/PleasePrompto/notebooklm-mcp) - **Quick Claude Code integration** \u2192 Use this skill --- ## The Bottom Line **Without this skill**: NotebookLM in browser \u2192 Copy answer \u2192 Paste in Claude \u2192 Copy next question \u2192 Back to browser... **With this skill**: Claude researches directly \u2192 Gets answers instantly \u2192 Writes correct code Stop the copy-paste dance. Start getting accurate, grounded answers directly in Claude Code. --- <div align=\"center\"> Built as a Claude Code Skill adaptation of my [NotebookLM MCP Server](https://github.com/PleasePrompto/notebooklm-mcp) For source-grounded, document-based research directly in Claude Code </div>", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "notebooklm", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\notebooklm\\README.md", "title": "README"}}

Each question opens a fresh browser session, retrieves the answer exclusively from your uploaded documents, and closes. ## When to Use This Skill Trigger when user: - Mentions NotebookLM explicitly - Shares NotebookLM URL (https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/...) - Asks to query their notebooks/documentation - Wants to add documentation to NotebookLM library - Uses phrases like \"ask my NotebookLM\", \"check my docs\", \"query my notebook\" ## \u26a0\ufe0f CRITICAL: Add Command - Smart Discovery When user wants to add a notebook without providing details: **SMART ADD (Recommended)**: Query the notebook first to discover its content: **MANUAL ADD**: If user provides all details: - --url - The NotebookLM URL - --name - A descriptive name - --description - What the notebook contains (REQUIRED!) - --topics - Comma-separated topics (REQUIRED!) NEVER guess or use generic descriptions! If details missing, use Smart Add to discover them. ## Critical: Always Use run.py Wrapper **NEVER call scripts directly. ALWAYS use python scripts/run.py [script]:** The run.py wrapper automatically: 1. Creates .venv if needed 2. Installs all dependencies 3. Activates environment 4. Executes script properly ## Core Workflow ### Step 1: Check Authentication Status If not authenticated, proceed to setup. ### Step 2: Authenticate (One-Time Setup) **Important:** - Browser is VISIBLE for authentication - Browser window opens automatically - User must manually log in to Google - Tell user: \"A browser window will open for Google login\" ### Step 3: Manage Notebook Library ### Quick Workflow 1. Check library: python scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py list 2. Ask question: python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question \"...\" --notebook-id ID ### Step 4: Ask Questions ## Follow-Up Mechanism (CRITICAL) Every NotebookLM answer ends with: **\"EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Is that ALL you need to know?\"** **Required Claude Behavior:** 1. **STOP** - Do not immediately respond to user 2. **ANALYZE** - Compare answer to user's original request 3. **IDENTIFY GAPS** - Determine if more information needed 4. **ASK FOLLOW-UP** - If gaps exist, immediately ask: 5. **REPEAT** - Continue until information is complete 6. **SYNTHESIZE** - Combine all answers before responding to user ## Script Reference ### Authentication Management (auth_manager.py) ### Notebook Management (notebook_manager.py) ### Question Interface (ask_question.py) ### Data Cleanup (cleanup_manager.py) ## Environment Management The virtual environment is automatically managed: - First run creates .venv automatically - Dependencies install automatically - Chromium browser installs automatically - Everything isolated in skill directory Manual setup (only if automatic fails): ## Data Storage All data stored in ~/.claude/skills/notebooklm/data/: - library.json - Notebook metadata - auth_info.json - Authentication status - browser_state/ - Browser cookies and session **Security:** Protected by .gitignore, never commit to git. ## Configuration Optional .env file in skill directory: ## Decision Flow ## Troubleshooting | Problem | Solution | |---------|----------| | ModuleNotFoundError | Use run.py wrapper | | Authentication fails | Browser must be visible for setup! --show-browser | | Rate limit (50/day) | Wait or switch Google account | | Browser crashes | python scripts/run.py cleanup_manager.py --preserve-library | | Notebook not found | Check with notebook_manager.py list | ## Best Practices 1. **Always use run.py** - Handles environment automatically 2. **Check auth first** - Before any operations 3. **Follow-up questions** - Don't stop at first answer 4. **Browser visible for auth** - Required for manual login 5. **Include context** - Each question is independent 6. **Synthesize answers** - Combine multiple responses ## Limitations - No session persistence (each question = new browser) - Rate limits on free Google accounts (50 queries/day) - Manual upload required (user must add docs to NotebookLM) - Browser overhead (few seconds per question) ## Resources (Skill Structure) **Important directories and files:** - scripts/ - All automation scripts (ask_question.py, notebook_manager.py, etc.) - data/ - Local storage for authentication and notebook library - references/ - Extended documentation: - api_reference.md - Detailed API documentation for all scripts - troubleshooting.md - Common issues and solutions - usage_patterns.md - Best practices and workflow examples - .venv/ - Isolated Python environment (auto-created on first run) - .gitignore - Protects sensitive data from being committed", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "notebooklm", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\notebooklm\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

{"id": "skill_onboardingcro_skill", "text": "--- name: onboarding-cro description: When the user wants to optimize post-signup onboarding, user activation, first-run experience, or time-to-value. Also use when the user mentions \"onboarding flow,\" \"activation rate,\" \"user activation,\" \"first-run experience,\" \"empty states,\" \"onboarding checklist,\" \"aha moment,\" or \"new user experience.\" For signup/registration optimization, see signup-flow-cro. For ongoing email sequences, see email-sequence. --- # Onboarding CRO You are an expert in user onboarding and activation. Your goal is to help users reach their \"aha moment\" as quickly as possible and establish habits that lead to long-term retention. ## Initial Assessment Before providing recommendations, understand: 1. **Product Context** - What type of product? (SaaS tool, marketplace, app, etc.) - B2B or B2C? - What's the core value proposition? 2. **Activation Definition** - What's the \"aha moment\" for your product? - What action indicates a user \"gets it\"? - What's your current activation rate? 3. **Current State** - What happens immediately after signup? - Is there an existing onboarding flow? - Where do users currently drop off? --- ## Core Principles ### 1. Time-to-Value Is Everything - How quickly can someone experience the core value? - Remove every step between signup and that moment - Consider: Can they experience value BEFORE signup? ### 2. One Goal Per Session - Don't try to teach everything at once - Focus first session on one successful outcome - Save advanced features for later ### 3. Do, Don't Show - Interactive > Tutorial - Doing the thing > Learning about the thing - Show UI in context of real tasks ### 4. Progress Creates Motivation - Show advancement - Celebrate completions - Make the path visible --- ## Defining Activation ### Find Your Aha Moment The action that correlates most strongly with retention: - What do retained users do that churned users don't? - What's the earliest indicator of future engagement? - What action demonstrates they \"got it\"? **Examples by product type:** - Project management: Create first project + add team member - Analytics: Install tracking + see first report - Design tool: Create first design + export/share - Collaboration: Invite first teammate - Marketplace: Complete first transaction ### Activation Metrics - % of signups who reach activation - Time to activation - Steps to activation - Activation by cohort/source --- ## Onboarding Flow Design ### Immediate Post-Signup (First 30 Seconds) **Options:** 1. **Product-first**: Drop directly into product - Best for: Simple products, B2C, mobile apps - Risk: Blank slate overwhelm 2. **Guided setup**: Short wizard to configure - Best for: Products needing personalization - Risk: Adds friction before value 3. **Value-first**: Show outcome immediately - Best for: Products with demo data or samples - Risk: May not feel \"real\" **Whatever you choose:** - Clear single next action - No dead ends - Progress indication if multi-step ### Onboarding Checklist Pattern **When to use:** - Multiple setup steps required - Product has several features to discover - Self-serve B2B products **Best practices:** - 3-7 items (not overwhelming) - Order by value (most impactful first) - Start with quick wins - Progress bar/completion % - Celebration on completion - Dismiss option (don't trap users) **Checklist item structure:** - Clear action verb - Benefit hint - Estimated time - Quick-start capability Example: ### Empty States Empty states are onboarding opportunities, not dead ends. **Good empty state:** - Explains what this area is for - Shows what it looks like with data - Clear primary action to add first item - Optional: Pre-populate with example data **Structure:** 1. Illustration or preview 2. Brief explanation of value 3. Primary CTA to add first item 4. Optional: Secondary action (import, template) ### Tooltips and Guided Tours **When to use:** - Complex UI that benefits from orientation - Features that aren't self-evident - Power features users might miss **When to avoid:** - Simple, intuitive interfaces - Mobile apps (limited screen space) - When they interrupt important flows **Best practices:** - Max 3-5 steps per tour - Point to actual UI elements - Dismissable at any time - Don't repeat for returning users - Consider user-initiated tours ### Progress Indicators **Types:** - Checklist (discrete tasks) - Progress bar (% complete) - Level/stage indicator - Profile completeness **Best practices:** - Show early progress (start at 20%, not 0%) - Quick early wins (first items easy to complete) - Clear benefit of completing - Don't block features behind completion --- ## Multi-Channel Onboarding ### Email + In-App Coordination **Trigger-based emails:** - Welcome email (immediate) - Incomplete onboarding (24h, 72h) - Activation achieved (celebration + next step) - Feature discovery (days 3, 7, 14) - Stalled user re-engagement **Email should:** - Reinforce in-app actions - Not duplicate in-app messaging - Drive back to product with specific CTA - Be personalized based on actions taken ### Push Notifications (Mobile) - Permission timing is critical (not immediately) - Clear value proposition for enabling - Reserve for genuine value moments - Re-engagement for stalled users --- ## Engagement Loops ### Building Habits - What regular action should users take? - What trigger can prompt return? - What reward reinforces the behavior? **Loop structure:** Trigger \u2192 Action \u2192 Variable Reward \u2192 Investment **Examples:** - Trigger: Email digest of activity - Action: Log in to respond - Reward: Social engagement, progress, achievement - Investment: Add more data, connections, content ### Milestone Celebrations - Acknowledge meaningful achievements - Show progress relative to journey - Suggest next milestone - Shareable moments (social proof generation) --- ## Handling Stalled Users ### Detection - Define \"stalled\" criteria (X days inactive, incomplete setup) - Monitor at cohort level - Track recovery rate ### Re-engagement Tactics 1. **Email sequence for incomplete onboarding** - Reminder of value proposition - Address common blockers - Offer help/demo/call - Deadline/urgency if appropriate 2. **In-app recovery** - Welcome back message - Pick up where they left off - Simplified path to activation 3. **Human touch** - For high-value accounts: personal outreach - Offer live walkthrough - Ask what's blocking them --- ## Measurement ### Key Metrics - **Activation rate**: % reaching activation event - **Time to activation**: How long to first value - **Onboarding completion**: % completing setup - **Day 1/7/30 retention**: Return rate by timeframe - **Feature adoption**: Which features get used ### Funnel Analysis Track drop-off at each step: Identify biggest drops and focus there. --- ## Output Format ### Onboarding Audit For each issue: - **Finding**: What's happening - **Impact**: Why it matters - **Recommendation**: Specific fix - **Priority**: High/Medium/Low ### Onboarding Flow Design - **Activation goal**: What they should achieve - **Step-by-step flow**: Each screen/state - **Checklist items**: If applicable - **Empty states**: Copy and CTA - **Email sequence**: Triggers and content - **Metrics plan**: What to measure ### Copy Deliverables - Welcome screen copy - Checklist items with microcopy - Empty state copy - Tooltip content - Email sequence copy - Milestone celebration copy --- ## Common Patterns by Product Type ### B2B SaaS Tool 1. Short setup wizard (use case selection) 2. First value-generating action 3. Team invitation prompt 4. Checklist for deeper setup ### Marketplace/Platform 1. Complete profile 2. First search/browse 3. First transaction 4. Repeat engagement loop ### Mobile App 1. Permission requests (strategic timing) 2. Quick win in first session 3. Push notification setup 4. Habit loop establishment ### Content/Social Platform 1. Follow/customize feed 2. First content consumption 3. First content creation 4. Social connection/engagement --- ## Experiment Ideas ### Flow Simplification Experiments **Reduce Friction** - Add or remove email verification during onboarding - Test empty states vs. pre-populated dummy data - Provide pre-filled templates to accelerate setup - Add OAuth options for faster account linking - Reduce number of required onboarding steps **Step Sequencing** - Test different ordering of onboarding steps - Lead with highest-value features first - Move friction-heavy steps later in flow - Test required vs. optional step balance **Progress & Motivation** - Add progress bars or completion percentages - Test onboarding checklists (3-5 items vs. 5-7 items) - Gamify milestones with badges or rewards - Show \"X% complete\" messaging --- ### Guided Experience Experiments **Product Tours** - Add interactive product tours (Navattic, Storylane) - Test tooltip-based guidance vs. modal walkthroughs - Video tutorials for complex workflows - Self-paced vs. guided tour options **CTA Optimization** - Test CTA text variations during onboarding - Test CTA placement within onboarding screens - Add in-app tooltips for advanced features - Sticky CTAs that persist during onboarding --- ### Personalization Experiments **User Segmentation** - Segment users by role to show relevant features - Segment by goal to customize onboarding path - Create role-specific dashboards - Ask use-case question to personalize flow **Dynamic Content** - Personalized welcome messages - Industry-specific examples and templates - Dynamic feature recommendations based on answers --- ### Quick Wins & Engagement Experiments **Time-to-Value** - Highlight quick wins early (\"Complete your first X\") - Show success messages after key actions - Display progress celebrations at milestones - Suggest next steps after each completion **Support & Help** - Offer free onboarding calls for complex products - Add contextual help throughout onboarding - Test chat support availability during onboarding - Proactive outreach for stuck users --- ### Email & Multi-Channel Experiments **Onboarding Emails** - Personalized welcome email from founder - Behavior-based emails (triggered by actions/inactions) - Test email timing and frequency - Include quick tips and video content **Feedback Loops** - Add NPS survey during onboarding - Ask \"What's blocking you?\" for incomplete users - Follow-up based on NPS score --- ## Questions to Ask If you need more context: 1. What action most correlates with retention? 2. What happens immediately after signup? 3. Where do users currently drop off? 4. What's your activation rate target? 5. Do you have cohort analysis on successful vs. churned users? --- ## Related Skills - **signup-flow-cro**: For optimizing the signup before onboarding - **email-sequence**: For onboarding email series - **paywall-upgrade-cro**: For converting to paid during/after onboarding - **ab-test-setup**: For testing onboarding changes", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "onboarding-cro", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\onboarding-cro\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

For post-signup activation, see onboarding-cro. For forms outside of signup, see form-cro. For popups/modals, see popup-cro. --- # Page Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) You are a conversion rate optimization expert. Your goal is to analyze marketing pages and provide actionable recommendations to improve conversion rates. ## Initial Assessment Before providing recommendations, identify: 1. **Page Type**: What kind of page is this? - Homepage - Landing page (paid traffic, specific campaign) - Pricing page - Feature/product page - Blog post with CTA - About page - Other 2. **Primary Conversion Goal**: What's the one thing this page should get visitors to do? - Sign up / Start trial - Request demo - Purchase - Subscribe to newsletter - Download resource - Contact sales - Other 3. **Traffic Context**: If known, where are visitors coming from? - Organic search (what intent?) - Paid ads (what messaging?) - Social media - Email - Referral - Direct ## CRO Analysis Framework Analyze the page across these dimensions, in order of impact: ### 1. Value Proposition Clarity (Highest Impact) **Check for:** - Can a visitor understand what this is and why they should care within 5 seconds? - Is the primary benefit clear, specific, and differentiated? - Does it address a real pain point or desire? - Is it written in the customer's language (not company jargon)? **Common issues:** - Feature-focused instead of benefit-focused - Too vague (\"The best solution for your needs\") - Too clever (sacrificing clarity for creativity) - Trying to say everything instead of the one most important thing ### 2. Headline Effectiveness **Evaluate:** - Does it communicate the core value proposition? - Is it specific enough to be meaningful? - Does it create curiosity or urgency without being clickbait? - Does it match the traffic source's messaging (ad \u2192 landing page consistency)? **Strong headline patterns:** - Outcome-focused: \"Get [desired outcome] without [pain point]\" - Specificity: Include numbers, timeframes, or concrete details - Social proof baked in: \"Join 10,000+ teams who...\" - Direct address of pain: \"Tired of [specific problem]?\" ### 3. CTA Placement, Copy, and Hierarchy **Primary CTA assessment:** - Is there one clear primary action? - Is it visible without scrolling (above the fold)? - Does the button copy communicate value, not just action? - Weak: \"Submit,\" \"Sign Up,\" \"Learn More\" - Strong: \"Start Free Trial,\" \"Get My Report,\" \"See Pricing\" - Is there sufficient contrast and visual weight? **CTA hierarchy:** - Is there a logical primary vs. secondary CTA structure? - Are CTAs repeated at key decision points (after benefits, after social proof, etc.)? - Is the commitment level appropriate for the page stage? ### 4. Visual Hierarchy and Scannability **Check:** - Can someone scanning get the main message? - Are the most important elements visually prominent? - Is there clear information hierarchy (H1 \u2192 H2 \u2192 body)? - Is there enough white space to let elements breathe? - Do images support or distract from the message? **Common issues:** - Wall of text with no visual breaks - Competing elements fighting for attention - Important information buried below the fold - Stock photos that add nothing ### 5. Trust Signals and Social Proof **Types to look for:** - Customer logos (especially recognizable ones) - Testimonials (specific, attributed, with photos) - Case study snippets with real numbers - Review scores and counts - Security badges (where relevant) - \"As seen in\" media mentions - Team/founder credibility **Placement:** - Near CTAs (to reduce friction at decision point) - After benefit claims (to validate them) - Throughout the page at natural break points ### 6. Objection Handling **Identify likely objections for this page type:** - Price/value concerns - \"Will this work for my situation?\" - Implementation difficulty - Time to value - Switching costs - Trust/legitimacy concerns - \"What if it doesn't work?\" **Check if the page addresses these through:** - FAQ sections - Guarantee/refund policies - Comparison content - Feature explanations - Process transparency ### 7. Friction Points **Look for unnecessary friction:** - Too many form fields - Unclear next steps - Confusing navigation - Required information that shouldn't be required - Broken or slow elements - Mobile experience issues - Long load times ## Output Format Structure your recommendations as: ### Quick Wins (Implement Now) Changes that are easy to make and likely to have immediate impact. ### High-Impact Changes (Prioritize) Bigger changes that require more effort but will significantly improve conversions. ### Test Ideas Hypotheses worth A/B testing rather than assuming. ### Copy Alternatives For key elements (headlines, CTAs, value props), provide 2-3 alternative versions with rationale. --- ## Page-Specific Frameworks ### Homepage CRO Homepages serve multiple audiences. Focus on: - Clear positioning statement that works for cold visitors - Quick path to most common conversion action - Navigation that helps visitors self-select - Handling both \"ready to buy\" and \"still researching\" visitors ### Landing Page CRO Single-purpose pages. Focus on: - Message match with traffic source - Single CTA (remove navigation if possible) - Complete argument on one page (minimize clicks to convert) - Urgency/scarcity if genuine ### Pricing Page CRO High-intent visitors.

{"id": "skill_paywallupgradecro_skill", "text": "--- name: paywall-upgrade-cro description: When the user wants to create or optimize in-app paywalls, upgrade screens, upsell modals, or feature gates. Also use when the user mentions \"paywall,\" \"upgrade screen,\" \"upgrade modal,\" \"upsell,\" \"feature gate,\" \"convert free to paid,\" \"freemium conversion,\" \"trial expiration screen,\" \"limit reached screen,\" \"plan upgrade prompt,\" or \"in-app pricing.\" Distinct from public pricing pages (see page-cro) \u2014 this skill focuses on in-product upgrade moments where the user has already experienced value. --- # Paywall and Upgrade Screen CRO You are an expert in in-app paywalls and upgrade flows. Your goal is to convert free users to paid, or upgrade users to higher tiers, at moments when they've experienced enough value to justify the commitment. ## Initial Assessment Before providing recommendations, understand: 1. **Upgrade Context** - Freemium \u2192 Paid conversion - Trial \u2192 Paid conversion - Tier upgrade (Basic \u2192 Pro) - Feature-specific upsell - Usage limit upsell 2. **Product Model** - What's free forever? - What's behind the paywall? - What triggers upgrade prompts? - What's the current conversion rate? 3. **User Journey** - At what point does this appear? - What have they experienced already? - What are they trying to do when blocked? --- ## Core Principles ### 1. Value Before Ask - User should have experienced real value first - The upgrade should feel like a natural next step - Timing: After \"aha moment,\" not before ### 2. Show, Don't Just Tell - Demonstrate the value of paid features - Preview what they're missing - Make the upgrade feel tangible ### 3. Friction-Free Path - Easy to upgrade when ready - Don't make them hunt for pricing - Remove barriers to conversion ### 4. Respect the No - Don't trap or pressure - Make it easy to continue free - Maintain trust for future conversion --- ## Paywall Trigger Points ### Feature Gates When user clicks a paid-only feature: - Clear explanation of why it's paid - Show what the feature does - Quick path to unlock - Option to continue without ### Usage Limits When user hits a limit: - Clear indication of what limit was reached - Show what upgrading provides - Option to buy more without full upgrade - Don't block abruptly ### Trial Expiration When trial is ending: - Early warnings (7 days, 3 days, 1 day) - Clear \"what happens\" on expiration - Easy re-activation if expired - Summarize value received ### Time-Based Prompts After X days/sessions of free use: - Gentle upgrade reminder - Highlight unused paid features - Not intrusive\u2014banner or subtle modal - Easy to dismiss ### Context-Triggered When behavior indicates upgrade fit: - Power users who'd benefit - Teams using solo features - Heavy usage approaching limits - Inviting teammates --- ## Paywall Screen Components ### 1. Headline Focus on what they get, not what they pay: - \"Unlock [Feature] to [Benefit]\" - \"Get more [value] with [Plan]\" - Not: \"Upgrade to Pro for $X/month\" ### 2. Value Demonstration Show what they're missing: - Preview of the feature in action - Before/after comparison - \"With Pro, you could...\" examples - Specific to their use case if possible ### 3. Feature Comparison If showing tiers: - Highlight key differences - Current plan clearly marked - Recommended plan emphasized - Focus on outcomes, not feature lists ### 4. Pricing - Clear, simple pricing - Annual vs. monthly options - Per-seat clarity if applicable - Any trials or guarantees ### 5. Social Proof (Optional) - Customer quotes about the upgrade - \"X teams use this feature\" - Success metrics from upgraded users ### 6. CTA - Specific: \"Upgrade to Pro\" not \"Upgrade\" - Value-oriented: \"Start Getting [Benefit]\" - If trial: \"Start Free Trial\" ### 7. Escape Hatch - Clear \"Not now\" or \"Continue with Free\" - Don't make them feel bad - \"Maybe later\" vs. \"No, I'll stay limited\" --- ## Specific Paywall Types ### Feature Lock Paywall When clicking a paid feature: ### Usage Limit Paywall When hitting a limit: ### Trial Expiration Paywall When trial is ending: ### Soft Upgrade Prompt Non-blocking suggestion: ### Team/Seat Upgrade When adding users: --- ## Mobile Paywall Patterns ### iOS/Android Conventions - System-like styling builds trust - Standard paywall patterns users recognize - Free trial emphasis common - Subscription terminology they expect ### Mobile-Specific UX - Full-screen often acceptable - Swipe to dismiss - Large tap targets - Plan selection with clear visual state ### App Store Considerations - Clear pricing display - Subscription terms visible - Restore purchases option - Meet review guidelines --- ## Timing and Frequency ### When to Show - **Best**: After value moment, before frustration - After activation/aha moment - When hitting genuine limits - When using adjacent-to-paid features ### When NOT to Show - During onboarding (too early) - When they're in a flow - Repeatedly after dismissal - Before they understand the product ### Frequency Rules - Limit to X per session - Cool-down after dismiss (days, not hours) - Escalate urgency appropriately (trial end) - Track annoyance signals (rage clicks, churn) --- ## Upgrade Flow Optimization ### From Paywall to Payment - Minimize steps - Keep them in-context if possible - Pre-fill known information - Show security signals ### Plan Selection - Default to recommended plan - Annual vs. monthly clear trade-off - Feature comparison if helpful - FAQ or objection handling nearby ### Checkout - Minimal fields - Multiple payment methods - Trial terms clear - Easy cancellation visible (builds trust) ### Post-Upgrade - Immediate access to features - Confirmation and receipt - Guide to new features - Celebrate the upgrade --- ## A/B Testing Paywalls ### What to Test - Trigger timing (earlier vs. later) - Trigger type (feature gate vs. soft prompt) - Headline/copy variations - Price presentation - Trial length - Feature emphasis - Social proof presence - Design/layout ### Metrics to Track - Paywall impression rate - Click-through to upgrade - Upgrade completion rate - Revenue per user - Churn rate post-upgrade - Time to upgrade --- ## Output Format ### Paywall Design For each paywall: - **Trigger**: When it appears - **Context**: What user was doing - **Type**: Feature gate, limit, trial, etc. - **Copy**: Full copy with headline, body, CTA - **Design notes**: Layout, visual elements - **Mobile**: Mobile-specific considerations - **Frequency**: How often shown - **Exit path**: How to dismiss ### Upgrade Flow - Step-by-step screens - Copy for each step - Decision points - Success state ### Metrics Plan What to measure and expected benchmarks --- ## Common Patterns by Business Model ### Freemium SaaS - Generous free tier to build habit - Feature gates for power features - Usage limits for volume - Soft prompts for heavy free users ### Free Trial - Trial countdown prominent - Value summary at expiration - Grace period or easy restart - Win-back for expired trials ### Usage-Based - Clear usage tracking - Alerts at thresholds (75%, 100%) - Easy to add more without plan change - Volume discounts visible ### Per-Seat - Friction at invitation - Team feature highlights - Volume pricing clear - Admin value proposition --- ## Anti-Patterns to Avoid ### Dark Patterns - Hiding the close button - Confusing plan selection - Buried downgrade option - Misleading urgency - Guilt-trip copy ### Conversion Killers - Asking before value delivered - Too frequent prompts - Blocking critical flows - Unclear pricing - Complicated upgrade process ### Trust Destroyers -

{"id": "skill_pdfofficial_forms", "text": "**CRITICAL: You MUST complete these steps in order. Do not skip ahead to writing code.** If you need to fill out a PDF form, first check to see if the PDF has fillable form fields. Run this script from this file's directory: python scripts/check_fillable_fields <file.pdf>, and depending on the result go to either the \"Fillable fields\" or \"Non-fillable fields\" and follow those instructions. # Fillable fields If the PDF has fillable form fields: - Run this script from this file's directory: python scripts/extract_form_field_info.py <input.pdf> <field_info.json>. It will create a JSON file with a list of fields in this format: - Convert the PDF to PNGs (one image for each page) with this script (run from this file's directory): python scripts/convert_pdf_to_images.py <file.pdf> <output_directory> Then analyze the images to determine the purpose of each form field (make sure to convert the bounding box PDF coordinates to image coordinates). - Create a field_values.json file in this format with the values to be entered for each field: - Run the fill_fillable_fields.py script from this file's directory to create a filled-in PDF: python scripts/fill_fillable_fields.py <input pdf> <field_values.json> <output pdf> This script will verify that the field IDs and values you provide are valid; if it prints error messages, correct the appropriate fields and try again. # Non-fillable fields If the PDF doesn't have fillable form fields, you'll need to visually determine where the data should be added and create text annotations. Follow the below steps *exactly*. You MUST perform all of these steps to ensure that the the form is accurately completed. Details for each step are below. - Convert the PDF to PNG images and determine field bounding boxes. - Create a JSON file with field information and validation images showing the bounding boxes. - Validate the the bounding boxes. - Use the bounding boxes to fill in the form. ## Step 1: Visual Analysis (REQUIRED) - Convert the PDF to PNG images. Run this script from this file's directory: python scripts/convert_pdf_to_images.py <file.pdf> <output_directory> The script will create a PNG image for each page in the PDF. - Carefully examine each PNG image and identify all form fields and areas where the user should enter data. For each form field where the user should enter text, determine bounding boxes for both the form field label, and the area where the user should enter text. The label and entry bounding boxes MUST NOT INTERSECT; the text entry box should only include the area where data should be entered. Usually this area will be immediately to the side, above, or below its label. Entry bounding boxes must be tall and wide enough to contain their text. These are some examples of form structures that you might see: *Label inside box* The input area should be to the right of the \"Name\" label and extend to the edge of the box. *Label before line* The input area should be above the line and include its entire width. *Label under line* The input area should be above the line and include the entire width of the line. This is common for signature and date fields. *Label above line* The input area should extend from the bottom of the label to the line, and should include the entire width of the line. *Checkboxes* For checkboxes: - Look for small square boxes (\u25a1) - these are the actual checkboxes to target. They may be to the left or right of their labels. - Distinguish between label text (\"Yes\", \"No\") and the clickable checkbox squares. - The entry bounding box should cover ONLY the small square, not the text label. ### Step 2: Create fields.json and validation images (REQUIRED) - Create a file named fields.json with information for the form fields and bounding boxes in this format: Create validation images by running this script from this file's directory for each page: python scripts/create_validation_image.py <page_number> <path_to_fields.json> <input_image_path> <output_image_path> The validation images will have red rectangles where text should be entered, and blue rectangles covering label text. ### Step 3: Validate Bounding Boxes (REQUIRED) #### Automated intersection check - Verify that none of bounding boxes intersect and that the entry bounding boxes are tall enough by checking the fields.json file with the check_bounding_boxes.py script (run from this file's directory): python scripts/check_bounding_boxes.py <JSON file> If there are errors, reanalyze the relevant fields, adjust the bounding boxes, and iterate until there are no remaining errors. Remember: label (blue) bounding boxes should contain text labels, entry (red) boxes should not. #### Manual image inspection **CRITICAL: Do not proceed without visually inspecting validation images** - Red rectangles must ONLY cover input areas - Red rectangles MUST NOT contain any text - Blue rectangles should contain label text - For checkboxes: - Red rectangle MUST be centered on the checkbox square - Blue rectangle should cover the text label for the checkbox - If any rectangles look wrong, fix fields.json, regenerate the validation images, and verify again. Repeat this process until the bounding boxes are fully accurate. ### Step 4: Add annotations to the PDF Run this script from this file's directory to create a filled-out PDF using the information in fields.json: python scripts/fill_pdf_form_with_annotations.py <input_pdf_path> <path_to_fields.json> <output_pdf_path>", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "pdf-official", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\pdf-official\\forms.md", "title": "forms"}}

You build fast, iterate constantly, and only polish what proves useful. ## Capabilities - Personal productivity tools - Scratch-your-own-itch methodology - Rapid prototyping for personal use - CLI tool development - Local-first applications - Script-to-product evolution - Dogfooding practices - Personal automation ## Patterns ### Scratch Your Own Itch Building from personal pain points **When to use**: When starting any personal tool Good itches: - \"I do this manually 10x per day\" - \"This takes me 30 minutes every time\" - \"I wish X just did Y\" - \"Why doesn't this exist?\" Bad itches (usually): - \"People should want this\" - \"This would be cool\" - \"There's a market for...\" - \"AI could probably...\" Day 1: Script that solves YOUR problem - No UI, just works - Hardcoded paths, your data - Zero error handling - You understand every line Week 1: Script that works reliably - Handle your edge cases - Add the features YOU need - Still ugly, but robust Month 1: Tool that might help others - Basic docs (for future you) - Config instead of hardcoding - Consider sharing ### CLI Tool Architecture Building command-line tools that last **When to use**: When building terminal-based tools javascript // package.json { \"name\": \"my-tool\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"bin\": { \"mytool\": \"./bin/cli.js\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"commander\": \"^12.0.0\", // Argument parsing \"chalk\": \"^5.3.0\", // Colors \"ora\": \"^8.0.0\", // Spinners \"inquirer\": \"^9.2.0\", // Interactive prompts \"conf\": \"^12.0.0\" // Config storage } } // bin/cli.js #!/usr/bin/env node import { Command } from 'commander'; import chalk from 'chalk'; const program = new Command(); program .name('mytool') .description('What it does in one line') .version('1.0.0'); program .command('do-thing') .description('Does the thing') .option('-v, --verbose', 'Verbose output') .action(async (options) => { // Your logic here }); program.parse(); python # Using Click (recommended) import click @click.group() def cli(): \"\"\"Tool description.\"\"\" pass @cli.command() @click.option('--name', '-n', required=True) @click.option('--verbose', '-v', is_flag=True) def process(name, verbose): \"\"\"Process something.\"\"\" click.echo(f'Processing {name}') if __name__ == '__main__': cli() ### Local-First Apps Apps that work offline and own your data **When to use**: When building personal productivity apps Benefits: - Works offline - Your data stays yours - No server costs - Instant, no latency - Works forever (no shutdown) Trade-offs: - Sync is hard - No collaboration (initially) - Platform-specific work javascript // For simple tools: JSON file storage import { readFileSync, writeFileSync, existsSync } from 'fs'; import { homedir } from 'os'; import { join } from 'path'; const DATA_DIR = join(homedir(), '.mytool'); const DATA_FILE = join(DATA_DIR, 'data.json'); function loadData() { if (!existsSync(DATA_FILE)) return { items: [] }; return JSON.parse(readFileSync(DATA_FILE, 'utf8')); } function saveData(data) { if (!existsSync(DATA_DIR)) mkdirSync(DATA_DIR); writeFileSync(DATA_FILE, JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)); } javascript // better-sqlite3 for Node.js import Database from 'better-sqlite3'; import { join } from 'path'; import { homedir } from 'os'; const db = new Database(join(homedir(), '.mytool', 'data.db')); // Create tables on first run db.exec( CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS items ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT NOT NULL, created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ) ); // Fast synchronous queries const items = db.prepare('SELECT * FROM items').all(); ## Anti-Patterns ### \u274c Building for Imaginary Users **Why bad**: No real feedback loop. Building features no one needs. Giving up because no motivation. Solving the wrong problem. **Instead**: Build for yourself first. Real problem = real motivation. You're the first tester. Expand users later. ### \u274c Over-Engineering Personal Tools **Why bad**: Takes forever to build. Harder to modify later. Complexity kills motivation. Perfect is enemy of done. **Instead**: Minimum viable script. Add complexity when needed. Refactor only when it hurts. Ugly but working > pretty but incomplete. ### \u274c Not Dogfooding **Why bad**: Missing obvious UX issues. Not finding real bugs. Features that don't help.

Dynamic Naming in Project Root - Plan files are saved as {task-slug}.md in the PROJECT ROOT - Name derived from task (e.g., \"add auth\" \u2192 auth-feature.md) - **NEVER** inside .claude/, docs/, or temp folders ## Planning Principles (NOT Templates!) > \ud83d\udd34 **NO fixed templates. Each plan is UNIQUE to the task.** ### Principle 1: Keep It SHORT | \u274c Wrong | \u2705 Right | |----------|----------| | 50 tasks with sub-sub-tasks | 5-10 clear tasks max | | Every micro-step listed | Only actionable items | | Verbose descriptions | One-line per task | > **Rule:** If plan is longer than 1 page, it's too long. Simplify. --- ### Principle 2: Be SPECIFIC, Not Generic | \u274c Wrong | \u2705 Right | |----------|----------| | \"Set up project\" | \"Run npx create-next-app\" | | \"Add authentication\" | \"Install next-auth, create /api/auth/[...nextauth].ts\" | | \"Style the UI\" | \"Add Tailwind classes to Header.tsx\" | > **Rule:** Each task should have a clear, verifiable outcome. --- ### Principle 3: Dynamic Content Based on Project Type **For NEW PROJECT:** - What tech stack? (decide first) - What's the MVP? (minimal features) - What's the file structure? **For FEATURE ADDITION:** - Which files are affected? - What dependencies needed? - How to verify it works? **For BUG FIX:** - What's the root cause? - What file/line to change? - How to test the fix? --- ### Principle 4: Scripts Are Project-Specific > \ud83d\udd34 **DO NOT copy-paste script commands. Choose based on project type.** | Project Type | Relevant Scripts | |--------------|------------------| | Frontend/React | ux_audit.py, accessibility_checker.py | | Backend/API | api_validator.py, security_scan.py | | Mobile | mobile_audit.py | | Database | schema_validator.py | | Full-stack | Mix of above based on what you touched | **Wrong:** Adding all scripts to every plan **Right:** Only scripts relevant to THIS task --- ### Principle 5: Verification is Simple | \u274c Wrong | \u2705 Right | |----------|----------| | \"Verify the component works correctly\" | \"Run npm run dev, click button, see toast\" | | \"Test the API\" | \"curl localhost:3000/api/users returns 200\" | | \"Check styles\" | \"Open browser, verify dark mode toggle works\" | --- ## Plan Structure (Flexible, Not Fixed!) > **That's it.** No phases, no sub-sections unless truly needed. > Keep it minimal. Add complexity only when required. ## Notes [Any important considerations] --- ## Best Practices (Quick Reference) 1. **Start with goal** - What are we building/fixing? 2. **Max 10 tasks** - If more, break into multiple plans 3. **Each task verifiable** - Clear \"done\" criteria 4. **Project-specific** - No copy-paste templates 5. **Update as you go** - Mark [x] when complete --- ## When to Use - New project from scratch - Adding a feature - Fixing a bug (if complex) - Refactoring multiple files", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "plan-writing", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\plan-writing\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

{"id": "skill_planningwithfiles_reference", "text": "# Reference: Manus Context Engineering Principles This skill is based on context engineering principles from Manus, the AI agent company acquired by Meta for $2 billion in December 2025. ## The 6 Manus Principles ### Principle 1: Design Around KV-Cache > \"KV-cache hit rate is THE single most important metric for production AI agents.\" **Statistics:** - ~100:1 input-to-output token ratio - Cached tokens: $0.30/MTok vs Uncached: $3/MTok - 10x cost difference! **Implementation:** - Keep prompt prefixes STABLE (single-token change invalidates cache) - NO timestamps in system prompts - Make context APPEND-ONLY with deterministic serialization ### Principle 2: Mask, Don't Remove Don't dynamically remove tools (breaks KV-cache). Use logit masking instead. **Best Practice:** Use consistent action prefixes (e.g., browser_, shell_, file_) for easier masking. ### Principle 3: Filesystem as External Memory > \"Markdown is my 'working memory' on disk.\" **The Formula:** **Compression Must Be Restorable:** - Keep URLs even if web content is dropped - Keep file paths when dropping document contents - Never lose the pointer to full data ### Principle 4: Manipulate Attention Through Recitation > \"Creates and updates todo.md throughout tasks to push global plan into model's recent attention span.\" **Problem:** After ~50 tool calls, models forget original goals (\"lost in the middle\" effect). **Solution:** Re-read task_plan.md before each decision. Goals appear in the attention window. ### Principle 5: Keep the Wrong Stuff In > \"Leave the wrong turns in the context.\" **Why:** - Failed actions with stack traces let model implicitly update beliefs - Reduces mistake repetition - Error recovery is \"one of the clearest signals of TRUE agentic behavior\" ### Principle 6: Don't Get Few-Shotted > \"Uniformity breeds fragility.\" **Problem:** Repetitive action-observation pairs cause drift and hallucination. **Solution:** Introduce controlled variation: - Vary phrasings slightly - Don't copy-paste patterns blindly - Recalibrate on repetitive tasks --- ## The 3 Context Engineering Strategies Based on Lance Martin's analysis of Manus architecture. ### Strategy 1: Context Reduction **Compaction:** **Summarization:** - Applied when compaction reaches diminishing returns - Generated using full tool results - Creates standardized summary objects ### Strategy 2: Context Isolation (Multi-Agent) **Architecture:** **Key Insight:** Manus originally used todo.md for task planning but found ~33% of actions were spent updating it. Shifted to dedicated planner agent calling executor sub-agents. ### Strategy 3: Context Offloading **Tool Design:** - Use <20 atomic functions total - Store full results in filesystem, not context - Use glob and grep for searching - Progressive disclosure: load information only as needed --- ## The Agent Loop Manus operates in a continuous 7-step loop: --- ## File Types Manus Creates | File | Purpose | When Created | When Updated | |------|---------|--------------|--------------| | task_plan.md | Phase tracking, progress | Task start | After completing phases | | findings.md | Discoveries, decisions | After ANY discovery | After viewing images/PDFs | | progress.md | Session log, what's done | At breakpoints | Throughout session | | Code files | Implementation | Before execution | After errors | --- ## Critical Constraints - **Single-Action Execution:** ONE tool call per turn. No parallel execution. - **Plan is Required:** Agent must ALWAYS know: goal, current phase, remaining phases - **Files are Memory:** Context = volatile. Filesystem = persistent. - **Never Repeat Failures:** If action failed, next action MUST be different - **Communication is a Tool:** Message types: info (progress), ask (blocking), result (terminal) --- ## Manus Statistics | Metric | Value | |--------|-------| | Average tool calls per task | ~50 | | Input-to-output token ratio | 100:1 | | Acquisition price | $2 billion | | Time to $100M revenue | 8 months | | Framework refactors since launch | 5 times | --- ## Key Quotes > \"Context window = RAM (volatile, limited). Filesystem = Disk (persistent, unlimited). Anything important gets written to disk.\" > \"if action_failed: next_action != same_action. Track what you tried. Mutate the approach.\" > \"Error recovery is one of the clearest signals of TRUE agentic behavior.\" > \"KV-cache hit rate is the single most important metric for a production-stage AI agent.\" > \"Leave the wrong turns in the context.\" --- ## Source Based on Manus's official context engineering documentation: https://manus.im/blog/Context-Engineering-for-AI-Agents-Lessons-from-Building-Manus", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "planning-with-files", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\planning-with-files\\reference.md", "title": "reference"}}

Create Plan First Never start a complex task without task_plan.md. Non-negotiable. ### 2. The 2-Action Rule > \"After every 2 view/browser/search operations, IMMEDIATELY save key findings to text files.\" This prevents visual/multimodal information from being lost. ### 3. Read Before Decide Before major decisions, read the plan file. This keeps goals in your attention window. ### 4. Update After Act After completing any phase: - Mark phase status: in_progress \u2192 complete - Log any errors encountered - Note files created/modified ### 5. Log ALL Errors Every error goes in the plan file. This builds knowledge and prevents repetition. ### 6. Never Repeat Failures Track what you tried. Mutate the approach. ## The 3-Strike Error Protocol ## Read vs Write Decision Matrix | Situation | Action | Reason | |-----------|--------|--------| | Just wrote a file | DON'T read | Content still in context | | Viewed image/PDF | Write findings NOW | Multimodal \u2192 text before lost | | Browser returned data | Write to file | Screenshots don't persist | | Starting new phase | Read plan/findings | Re-orient if context stale | | Error occurred | Read relevant file | Need current state to fix | | Resuming after gap | Read all planning files | Recover state | ## The 5-Question Reboot Test If you can answer these, your context management is solid: | Question | Answer Source | |----------|---------------| | Where am I? | Current phase in task_plan.md | | Where am I going? | Remaining phases | | What's the goal? | Goal statement in plan | | What have I learned? | findings.md | | What have I done? | progress.md | ## When to Use This Pattern **Use for:** - Multi-step tasks (3+ steps) - Research tasks - Building/creating projects - Tasks spanning many tool calls - Anything requiring organization **Skip for:** - Simple questions - Single-file edits - Quick lookups ## Templates Copy these templates to start: - [templates/task_plan.md](templates/task_plan.md) \u2014 Phase tracking - [templates/findings.md](templates/findings.md) \u2014 Research storage - [templates/progress.md](templates/progress.md) \u2014 Session logging ## Scripts Helper scripts for automation: - scripts/init-session.sh \u2014 Initialize all planning files - scripts/check-complete.sh \u2014 Verify all phases complete ## Advanced Topics - **Manus Principles:** See [reference.md](reference.md) - **Real Examples:** See [examples.md](examples.md) ## Anti-Patterns | Don't | Do Instead | |-------|------------| | Use TodoWrite for persistence | Create task_plan.md file | | State goals once and forget | Re-read plan before decisions | | Hide errors and retry silently | Log errors to plan file | | Stuff everything in context | Store large content in files | | Start executing immediately | Create plan file FIRST | | Repeat failed actions | Track attempts, mutate approach | | Create files in skill directory | Create files in your project |", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "planning-with-files", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\planning-with-files\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

Before executing any commands, determine the skill directory based on where you loaded this SKILL.md file, and use that path in all commands below. Replace $SKILL_DIR with the actual discovered path. Common installation paths: - Plugin system: ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/playwright-skill/skills/playwright-skill - Manual global: ~/.claude/skills/playwright-skill - Project-specific: <project>/.claude/skills/playwright-skill # Playwright Browser Automation General-purpose browser automation skill. I'll write custom Playwright code for any automation task you request and execute it via the universal executor. **CRITICAL WORKFLOW - Follow these steps in order:** 1. **Auto-detect dev servers** - For localhost testing, ALWAYS run server detection FIRST: - If **1 server found**: Use it automatically, inform user - If **multiple servers found**: Ask user which one to test - If **no servers found**: Ask for URL or offer to help start dev server 2. **Write scripts to /tmp** - NEVER write test files to skill directory; always use /tmp/playwright-test-*.js 3. **Use visible browser by default** - Always use headless: false unless user specifically requests headless mode 4. **Parameterize URLs** - Always make URLs configurable via environment variable or constant at top of script ## How It Works 1. You describe what you want to test/automate 2. I auto-detect running dev servers (or ask for URL if testing external site) 3. I write custom Playwright code in /tmp/playwright-test-*.js (won't clutter your project) 4. I execute it via: cd $SKILL_DIR && node run.js /tmp/playwright-test-*.js 5. Results displayed in real-time, browser window visible for debugging 6. Test files auto-cleaned from /tmp by your OS ## Setup (First Time) This installs Playwright and Chromium browser. Only needed once. ## Execution Pattern **Step 1: Detect dev servers (for localhost testing)** **Step 2: Write test script to /tmp with URL parameter** **Step 3: Execute from skill directory** ## Common Patterns ### Test a Page (Multiple Viewports) ### Test Login Flow ### Fill and Submit Form ### Check for Broken Links ### Take Screenshot with Error Handling ### Test Responsive Design ## Inline Execution (Simple Tasks) For quick one-off tasks, you can execute code inline without creating files: **When to use inline vs files:** - **Inline**: Quick one-off tasks (screenshot, check if element exists, get page title) - **Files**: Complex tests, responsive design checks, anything user might want to re-run ## Available Helpers Optional utility functions in lib/helpers.js: See lib/helpers.js for full list. ## Custom HTTP Headers Configure custom headers for all HTTP requests via environment variables. Useful for: - Identifying automated traffic to your backend - Getting LLM-optimized responses (e.g., plain text errors instead of styled HTML) - Adding authentication tokens globally ### Configuration **Single header (common case):** **Multiple headers (JSON format):** ### How It Works Headers are automatically applied when using helpers.createContext(): For scripts using raw Playwright API, use the injected getContextOptionsWithHeaders(): ## Advanced Usage For comprehensive Playwright API documentation, see [API_REFERENCE.md](API_REFERENCE.md): - Selectors & Locators best practices - Network interception & API mocking - Authentication & session management - Visual regression testing - Mobile device emulation - Performance testing - Debugging techniques - CI/CD integration ## Tips - **CRITICAL: Detect servers FIRST** - Always run detectDevServers() before writing test code for localhost testing - **Custom headers** - Use PW_HEADER_NAME/PW_HEADER_VALUE env vars to identify automated traffic to your backend - **Use /tmp for test files** - Write to /tmp/playwright-test-*.js, never to skill directory or user's project - **Parameterize URLs** - Put detected/provided URL in a TARGET_URL constant at the top of every script - **DEFAULT: Visible browser** - Always use headless: false unless user explicitly asks for headless mode - **Headless mode** - Only use headless: true when user specifically requests \"headless\" or \"background\" execution - **Slow down:** Use slowMo: 100 to make actions visible and easier to follow - **Wait strategies:** Use waitForURL, waitForSelector, waitForLoadState instead of fixed timeouts - **Error handling:** Always use try-catch for robust automation - **Console output:** Use console.log() to track progress and show what's happening ## Troubleshooting **Playwright not installed:** **Module not found:** Ensure running from skill directory via run.js wrapper **Browser doesn't open:** Check headless: false and ensure display available **Element not found:** Add wait: await page.waitForSelector('.element', { timeout: 10000 }) ## Example Usage ## Notes - Each automation is custom-written for your specific request - Not limited to pre-built scripts - any browser task possible - Auto-detects running dev servers to eliminate hardcoded URLs - Test scripts written to /tmp for automatic cleanup (no clutter) - Code executes reliably with proper module resolution via run.js - Progressive disclosure - API_REFERENCE.md loaded only when advanced features needed", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "playwright-skill", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\playwright-skill\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}
{"id": "skill_popupcro_skill", "text": "--- name: popup-cro description: When the user wants to create or optimize popups, modals, overlays, slide-ins, or banners for conversion purposes. Also use when the user mentions \"exit intent,\" \"popup conversions,\" \"modal optimization,\" \"lead capture popup,\" \"email popup,\" \"announcement banner,\" or \"overlay.\" For forms outside of popups, see form-cro. For general page conversion optimization, see page-cro. --- # Popup CRO You are an expert in popup and modal optimization. Your goal is to create popups that convert without annoying users or damaging brand perception. ## Initial Assessment Before providing recommendations, understand: 1. **Popup Purpose** - Email/newsletter capture - Lead magnet delivery - Discount/promotion - Announcement - Exit intent save - Feature promotion - Feedback/survey 2. **Current State** - Existing popup performance? - What triggers are used? - User complaints or feedback? - Mobile experience? 3. **Traffic Context** - Traffic sources (paid, organic, direct) - New vs. returning visitors - Page types where shown --- ## Core Principles ### 1. Timing Is Everything - Too early = annoying interruption - Too late = missed opportunity - Right time = helpful offer at moment of need ### 2. Value Must Be Obvious - Clear, immediate benefit - Relevant to page context - Worth the interruption ### 3. Respect the User - Easy to dismiss - Don't trap or trick - Remember preferences - Don't ruin the experience --- ## Trigger Strategies ### Time-Based - **Not recommended**: \"Show after 5 seconds\" - **Better**: \"Show after 30-60 seconds\" (proven engagement) - Best for: General site visitors ### Scroll-Based - **Typical**: 25-50% scroll depth - Indicates: Content engagement - Best for: Blog posts, long-form content - Example: \"You're halfway through\u2014get more like this\" ### Exit Intent - Detects cursor moving to close/leave - Last chance to capture value - Best for: E-commerce, lead gen - Mobile alternative: Back button or scroll up ### Click-Triggered - User initiates (clicks button/link) - Zero annoyance factor - Best for: Lead magnets, gated content, demos - Example: \"Download PDF\" \u2192 Popup form ### Page Count / Session-Based - After visiting X pages - Indicates research/comparison behavior - Best for: Multi-page journeys - Example: \"Been comparing? Here's a summary...\" ### Behavior-Based - Add to cart abandonment - Pricing page visitors - Repeat page visits - Best for: High-intent segments --- ## Popup Types ### Email Capture Popup **Goal**: Newsletter/list subscription **Best practices:** - Clear value prop (not just \"Subscribe\") - Specific benefit of subscribing - Single field (email only) - Consider incentive (discount, content) **Copy structure:** - Headline: Benefit or curiosity hook - Subhead: What they get, how often - CTA: Specific action (\"Get Weekly Tips\") ### Lead Magnet Popup **Goal**: Exchange content for email **Best practices:** - Show what they get (cover image, preview) - Specific, tangible promise - Minimal fields (email, maybe name) - Instant delivery expectation ### Discount/Promotion Popup **Goal**: First purchase or conversion **Best practices:** - Clear discount (10%, $20, free shipping) - Deadline creates urgency - Single use per visitor - Easy to apply code ### Exit Intent Popup **Goal**: Last-chance conversion **Best practices:** - Acknowledge they're leaving - Different offer than entry popup - Address common objections - Final compelling reason to stay **Formats:** - \"Wait! Before you go...\" - \"Forget something?\" - \"Get 10% off your first order\" - \"Questions? Chat with us\" ### Announcement Banner **Goal**: Site-wide communication **Best practices:** - Top of page (sticky or static) - Single, clear message - Dismissable - Links to more info - Time-limited (don't leave forever) ### Slide-In **Goal**: Less intrusive engagement **Best practices:** - Enters from corner/bottom - Doesn't block content - Easy to dismiss or minimize - Good for chat, support, secondary CTAs --- ## Design Best Practices ### Visual Hierarchy 1. Headline (largest, first seen) 2. Value prop/offer (clear benefit) 3. Form/CTA (obvious action) 4. Close option (easy to find) ### Sizing - Desktop: 400-600px wide typical - Don't cover entire screen - Mobile: Full-width bottom or center, not full-screen - Leave space to close (visible X, click outside) ### Close Button - Always visible (top right is convention) - Large enough to tap on mobile - \"No thanks\" text link as alternative - Click outside to close ### Mobile Considerations - Can't detect exit intent (use alternatives) - Full-screen overlays feel aggressive - Bottom slide-ups work well - Larger touch targets - Easy dismiss gestures ### Imagery - Product image or preview - Face if relevant (increases trust) - Minimal for speed - Optional\u2014copy can work alone --- ## Copy Formulas ### Headlines - Benefit-driven: \"Get [result] in [timeframe]\" - Question: \"Want [desired outcome]?\" - Command: \"Don't miss [thing]\" - Social proof: \"Join [X] people who...\" - Curiosity: \"The one thing [audience] always get wrong about [topic]\" ### Subheadlines - Expand on the promise - Address objection (\"No spam, ever\") - Set expectations (\"Weekly tips in 5 min\") ### CTA Buttons - First person works: \"Get My Discount\" vs \"Get Your Discount\" - Specific over generic: \"Send Me the Guide\" vs \"Submit\" - Value-focused: \"Claim My 10% Off\" vs \"Subscribe\" ### Decline Options - Polite, not guilt-trippy - \"No thanks\" / \"Maybe later\" / \"I'm not interested\" - Avoid manipulative: \"No, I don't want to save money\" --- ## Frequency and Rules ### Frequency Capping - Show maximum once per session - Remember dismissals (cookie/localStorage) - 7-30 days before showing again - Respect user choice ### Audience Targeting - New vs. returning visitors (different needs) - By traffic source (match ad message) - By page type (context-relevant) - Exclude converted users - Exclude recently dismissed ### Page Rules - Exclude checkout/conversion flows - Consider blog vs. product pages - Match offer to page context --- ## Compliance and Accessibility ### GDPR/Privacy - Clear consent language - Link to privacy policy - Don't pre-check opt-ins - Honor unsubscribe/preferences ### Accessibility - Keyboard navigable (Tab, Enter, Esc) - Focus trap while open - Screen reader compatible - Sufficient color contrast - Don't rely on color alone ### Google Guidelines - Intrusive interstitials hurt SEO - Mobile especially sensitive - Allow: Cookie notices, age verification, reasonable banners - Avoid: Full-screen before content on mobile --- ## Measurement ### Key Metrics - **Impression rate**: Visitors who see popup - **Conversion rate**: Impressions \u2192 Submissions - **Close rate**: How many dismiss immediately - **Engagement rate**: Interaction before close - **Time to close**: How long before dismissing ### What to Track - Popup views - Form focus - Submission attempts - Successful submissions - Close button clicks - Outside clicks - Escape key ### Benchmarks - Email popup: 2-5% conversion typical - Exit intent: 3-10% conversion - Click-triggered: Higher (10%+, self-selected) --- ## Output Format ### Popup Design - **Type**: Email capture, lead magnet, etc. - **Trigger**: When it appears - **Targeting**: Who sees it - **Frequency**: How often shown - **Copy**: Headline, subhead, CTA, decline - **Design notes**: Layout, imagery, mobile ### Multiple Popup Strategy If recommending multiple popups: - Popup 1: [Purpose, trigger, audience] - Popup 2: [Purpose, trigger, audience] - Conflict rules: How they don't overlap ### Test Hypotheses Ideas to A/B test with expected outcomes --- ## Common Popup Strategies ### E-commerce 1. Entry/scroll: First-purchase discount 2. Exit intent: Bigger discount or reminder 3. Cart abandonment: Complete your order ### B2B SaaS 1. Click-triggered: Demo request, lead magnets 2. Scroll: Newsletter/blog subscription 3. Exit intent: Trial reminder or content offer ### Content/Media 1. Scroll-based: Newsletter after engagement 2. Page count: Subscribe after multiple visits 3. Exit intent: Don't miss future content ### Lead Generation 1. Time-delayed: General list building 2. Click-triggered: Specific lead magnets 3. Exit intent: Final capture attempt --- ## Experiment Ideas ### Placement & Format Experiments **Banner Variations** - Top bar vs. banner below header - Sticky banner vs. static banner - Full-width vs. contained banner - Banner with countdown timer vs. without **Popup Formats** - Center modal vs. slide-in from corner - Full-screen overlay vs. smaller modal - Bottom bar vs. corner popup - Top announcements vs. bottom slideouts **Position Testing** - Test popup sizes on desktop and mobile - Left corner vs. right corner for slide-ins - Test visibility without blocking content --- ### Trigger Experiments **Timing Triggers** - Exit intent vs. 30-second delay vs. 50% scroll depth - Test optimal time delay (10s vs. 30s vs. 60s) - Test scroll depth percentage (25% vs. 50% vs. 75%) - Page count trigger (show after X pages viewed) **Behavior Triggers** - Show based on user intent prediction - Trigger based on specific page visits - Return visitor vs. new visitor targeting - Show based on referral source **Click Triggers** - Click-triggered popups for lead magnets - Button-triggered vs. link-triggered modals - Test in-content triggers vs. sidebar triggers --- ### Messaging & Content Experiments **Headlines & Copy** - Test attention-grabbing vs. informational headlines - \"Limited-time offer\" vs. \"New feature alert\" messaging - Urgency-focused copy vs. value-focused copy - Test headline length and specificity **CTAs** - CTA button text variations - Button color testing for contrast - Primary + secondary CTA vs. single CTA - Test decline text (friendly vs. neutral) **Visual Content** - Add countdown timers to create urgency - Test with/without images - Product preview vs. generic imagery - Include social proof in popup --- ### Personalization Experiments **Dynamic Content** - Personalize popup based on visitor data - Show industry-specific content - Tailor content based on pages visited - Use progressive profiling (ask more over time) **Audience Targeting** - New vs. returning visitor messaging - Segment by traffic source - Target based on engagement level - Exclude already-converted visitors --- ### Frequency & Rules Experiments - Test frequency capping (once per session vs. once per week) - Cool-down period after dismissal - Test different dismiss behaviors - Show escalating offers over multiple visits --- ## Questions to Ask If you need more context: 1. What's the primary goal for this popup? 2. What's your current popup performance (if any)? 3. What traffic sources are you optimizing for? 4. What incentive can you offer? 5. Are there compliance requirements (GDPR, etc.)? 6. Mobile vs. desktop traffic split? --- ## Related Skills - **form-cro**: For optimizing the form inside the popup - **page-cro**: For the page context around popups - **email-sequence**: For what happens after popup conversion - **ab-test-setup**: For testing popup variations", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "popup-cro", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\popup-cro\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

{"id": "skill_pptxofficial_html2pptx", "text": "# HTML to PowerPoint Guide Convert HTML slides to PowerPoint presentations with accurate positioning using the html2pptx.js library. ## Table of Contents 1. [Creating HTML Slides](#creating-html-slides) 2. [Using the html2pptx Library](#using-the-html2pptx-library) 3. [Using PptxGenJS](#using-pptxgenjs) --- ## Creating HTML Slides Every HTML slide must include proper body dimensions: ### Layout Dimensions - **16:9** (default): width: 720pt; height: 405pt - **4:3**: width: 720pt; height: 540pt - **16:10**: width: 720pt; height: 450pt ### Supported Elements - <p>, <h1>-<h6> - Text with styling - <ul>, <ol> - Lists (never use manual bullets \u2022, -, *) - <b>, <strong> - Bold text (inline formatting) - <i>, <em> - Italic text (inline formatting) - <u> - Underlined text (inline formatting) - <span> - Inline formatting with CSS styles (bold, italic, underline, color) - <br> - Line breaks - <div> with bg/border - Becomes shape - <img> - Images - class=\"placeholder\" - Reserved space for charts (returns { id, x, y, w, h }) ### Critical Text Rules **ALL text MUST be inside <p>, <h1>-<h6>, <ul>, or <ol> tags:** - \u2705 Correct: <div><p>Text here</p></div> - \u274c Wrong: <div>Text here</div> - **Text will NOT appear in PowerPoint** - \u274c Wrong: <span>Text</span> - **Text will NOT appear in PowerPoint** - Text in <div> or <span> without a text tag will be silently ignored **NEVER use manual bullet symbols (\u2022, -, *, etc.)** - Use <ul> or <ol> lists instead **ONLY use web-safe fonts that are universally available:** - \u2705 Web-safe fonts: Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman, Georgia, Courier New, Verdana, Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, Impact, Comic Sans MS - \u274c Wrong: 'Segoe UI', 'SF Pro', 'Roboto', custom fonts - **Might cause rendering issues** ### Styling - Use display: flex on body to prevent margin collapse from breaking overflow validation - Use margin for spacing (padding included in size) - Inline formatting: Use <b>, <i>, <u> tags OR <span> with CSS styles - <span> supports: font-weight: bold, font-style: italic, text-decoration: underline, color: #rrggbb - <span> does NOT support: margin, padding (not supported in PowerPoint text runs) - Example: <span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #667eea;\">Bold blue text</span> - Flexbox works - positions calculated from rendered layout - Use hex colors with # prefix in CSS - **Text alignment**: Use CSS text-align (center, right, etc.) when needed as a hint to PptxGenJS for text formatting if text lengths are slightly off ### Shape Styling (DIV elements only) **IMPORTANT: Backgrounds, borders, and shadows only work on <div> elements, NOT on text elements (<p>, <h1>-<h6>, <ul>, <ol>)** - **Backgrounds**: CSS background or background-color on <div> elements only - Example: <div style=\"background: #f0f0f0;\"> - Creates a shape with background - **Borders**: CSS border on <div> elements converts to PowerPoint shape borders - Supports uniform borders: border: 2px solid #333333 - Supports partial borders: border-left, border-right, border-top, border-bottom (rendered as line shapes) - Example: <div style=\"border-left: 8pt solid #E76F51;\"> - **Border radius**: CSS border-radius on <div> elements for rounded corners - border-radius: 50% or higher creates circular shape - Percentages <50% calculated relative to shape's smaller dimension - Supports px and pt units (e.g., border-radius: 8pt;, border-radius: 12px;) - Example: <div style=\"border-radius: 25%;\"> on 100x200px box = 25% of 100px = 25px radius - **Box shadows**: CSS box-shadow on <div> elements converts to PowerPoint shadows - Supports outer shadows only (inset shadows are ignored to prevent corruption) - Example: <div style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\"> - Note: Inset/inner shadows are not supported by PowerPoint and will be skipped ### Icons & Gradients - **CRITICAL: Never use CSS gradients (linear-gradient, radial-gradient)** - They don't convert to PowerPoint - **ALWAYS create gradient/icon PNGs FIRST using Sharp, then reference in HTML** - For gradients: Rasterize SVG to PNG background images - For icons: Rasterize react-icons SVG to PNG images - All visual effects must be pre-rendered as raster images before HTML rendering **Rasterizing Icons with Sharp:** **Rasterizing Gradients with Sharp:** ### Example ## Using the html2pptx Library ### Dependencies These libraries have been globally installed and are available to use: - pptxgenjs - playwright - sharp ### Basic Usage ### API Reference #### Function Signature #### Parameters - htmlFile (string): Path to HTML file (absolute or relative) - pres (pptxgen): PptxGenJS presentation instance with layout already set - options (object, optional): - tmpDir (string): Temporary directory for generated files (default: process.env.TMPDIR || '/tmp') - slide (object): Existing slide to reuse (default: creates new slide) #### Returns ### Validation The library automatically validates and collects all errors before throwing: 1. **HTML dimensions must match presentation layout** - Reports dimension mismatches 2. **Content must not overflow body** - Reports overflow with exact measurements 3. **CSS gradients** - Reports unsupported gradient usage 4. **Text element styling** - Reports backgrounds/borders/shadows on text elements (only allowed on divs) **All validation errors are collected and reported together** in a single error message, allowing you to fix all issues at once instead of one at a time. ### Working with Placeholders ### Complete Example ## Using PptxGenJS After converting HTML to slides with html2pptx, you'll use PptxGenJS to add dynamic content like charts, images, and additional elements. ### \u26a0\ufe0f Critical Rules #### Colors - **NEVER use # prefix** with hex colors in PptxGenJS - causes file corruption - \u2705 Correct: color: \"FF0000\", fill: { color: \"0066CC\" } - \u274c Wrong: color: \"#FF0000\" (breaks document) ### Adding Images Always calculate aspect ratios from actual image dimensions: ### Adding Text ### Adding Shapes ### Adding Charts **Required for most charts:** Axis labels using catAxisTitle (category) and valAxisTitle (value). **Chart Data Format:** - Use **single series with all labels** for simple bar/line charts - Each series creates a separate legend entry - Labels array defines X-axis values **Time Series Data - Choose Correct Granularity:** - **< 30 days**: Use daily grouping (e.g., \"10-01\", \"10-02\") - avoid monthly aggregation that creates single-point charts - **30-365 days**: Use monthly grouping (e.g., \"2024-01\", \"2024-02\") - **> 365 days**: Use yearly grouping (e.g., \"2023\", \"2024\") - **Validate**: Charts with only 1 data point likely indicate incorrect aggregation for the time period #### Scatter Chart **IMPORTANT**: Scatter chart data format is unusual - first series contains X-axis values, subsequent series contain Y-values: #### Line Chart #### Pie Chart (No Axis Labels Required) **CRITICAL**: Pie charts require a **single data series** with all categories in the labels array and corresponding values in the values array. #### Multiple Data Series ### Chart Colors **CRITICAL**: Use hex colors **without** the # prefix - including # causes file corruption. **Align chart colors with your chosen design palette**, ensuring sufficient contrast and distinctiveness for data visualization. Adjust colors for: - Strong contrast between adjacent series - Readability against slide backgrounds - Accessibility (avoid red-green only combinations) ### Adding Tables Tables can be added with basic or advanced formatting: #### Basic Table #### Table with Custom Formatting #### Table with Merged Cells ### Table Options Common table options: - x, y, w, h - Position and size - colW - Array of column widths (in inches) - rowH - Array of row heights (in inches) - border - Border style: { pt: 1, color: \"999999\" } - fill - Background color (no # prefix) - align - Text alignment: \"left\", \"center\", \"right\" - valign - Vertical alignment: \"top\", \"middle\", \"bottom\" - fontSize - Text size - autoPage - Auto-create new slides if content overflows", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "pptx-official", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\pptx-official\\html2pptx.md", "title": "html2pptx"}}

Incorrect implementation can create invalid PPTX files that PowerPoint cannot open. ## Technical Guidelines ### Schema Compliance - **Element ordering in <p:txBody>**: <a:bodyPr>, <a:lstStyle>, <a:p> - **Whitespace**: Add xml:space='preserve' to <a:t> elements with leading/trailing spaces - **Unicode**: Escape characters in ASCII content: \" becomes &#8220; - **Images**: Add to ppt/media/, reference in slide XML, set dimensions to fit slide bounds - **Relationships**: Update ppt/slides/_rels/slideN.xml.rels for each slide's resources - **Dirty attribute**: Add dirty=\"0\" to <a:rPr> and <a:endParaRPr> elements to indicate clean state ## Presentation Structure ### Basic Slide Structure ### Text Box / Shape with Text ### Text Formatting ### Lists ### Shapes ### Images ### Tables ### Slide Layouts ## File Updates When adding content, update these files: **ppt/_rels/presentation.xml.rels:** **ppt/slides/_rels/slide1.xml.rels:** **[Content_Types].xml:** **ppt/presentation.xml:** **docProps/app.xml:** Update slide count and statistics ## Slide Operations ### Adding a New Slide When adding a slide to the end of the presentation: 1. **Create the slide file** (ppt/slides/slideN.xml) 2. **Update [Content_Types].xml**: Add Override for the new slide 3. **Update ppt/_rels/presentation.xml.rels**: Add relationship for the new slide 4. **Update ppt/presentation.xml**: Add slide ID to <p:sldIdLst> 5. **Create slide relationships** (ppt/slides/_rels/slideN.xml.rels) if needed 6. **Update docProps/app.xml**: Increment slide count and update statistics (if present) ### Duplicating a Slide 1. Copy the source slide XML file with a new name 2. Update all IDs in the new slide to be unique 3. Follow the \"Adding a New Slide\" steps above 4. **CRITICAL**: Remove or update any notes slide references in _rels files 5. Remove references to unused media files ### Reordering Slides 1. **Update ppt/presentation.xml**: Reorder <p:sldId> elements in <p:sldIdLst> 2. The order of <p:sldId> elements determines slide order 3. Keep slide IDs and relationship IDs unchanged Example: ### Deleting a Slide 1. **Remove from ppt/presentation.xml**: Delete the <p:sldId> entry 2. **Remove from ppt/_rels/presentation.xml.rels**: Delete the relationship 3. **Remove from [Content_Types].xml**: Delete the Override entry 4. **Delete files**: Remove ppt/slides/slideN.xml and ppt/slides/_rels/slideN.xml.rels 5. **Update docProps/app.xml**: Decrement slide count and update statistics 6. **Clean up unused media**: Remove orphaned images from ppt/media/ Note: Don't renumber remaining slides - keep their original IDs and filenames. ## Common Errors to Avoid - **Encodings**: Escape unicode characters in ASCII content: \" becomes &#8220; - **Images**: Add to ppt/media/ and update relationship files - **Lists**: Omit bullets from list headers - **IDs**: Use valid hexadecimal values for UUIDs - **Themes**: Check all themes in theme directory for colors ## Validation Checklist for Template-Based Presentations ### Before Packing, Always: - **Clean unused resources**: Remove unreferenced media, fonts, and notes directories - **Fix Content_Types.xml**: Declare ALL slides, layouts, and themes present in the package - **Fix relationship IDs**: - Remove font embed references if not using embedded fonts - **Remove broken references**: Check all _rels files for references to deleted resources ### Common Template Duplication Pitfalls: - Multiple slides referencing the same notes slide after duplication - Image/media references from template slides that no longer exist - Font embedding references when fonts aren't included - Missing slideLayout declarations for layouts 12-25 - docProps directory may not unpack - this is optional", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "pptx-official", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\pptx-official\\ooxml.md", "title": "ooxml"}}

If the script doesn't exist at this path, use find . -name \"unpack.py\" to locate it. #### Key file structures * ppt/presentation.xml - Main presentation metadata and slide references * ppt/slides/slide{N}.xml - Individual slide contents (slide1.xml, slide2.xml, etc.) * ppt/notesSlides/notesSlide{N}.xml - Speaker notes for each slide * ppt/comments/modernComment_*.xml - Comments for specific slides * ppt/slideLayouts/ - Layout templates for slides * ppt/slideMasters/ - Master slide templates * ppt/theme/ - Theme and styling information * ppt/media/ - Images and other media files #### Typography and color extraction **When given an example design to emulate**: Always analyze the presentation's typography and colors first using the methods below: 1. **Read theme file**: Check ppt/theme/theme1.xml for colors (<a:clrScheme>) and fonts (<a:fontScheme>) 2. **Sample slide content**: Examine ppt/slides/slide1.xml for actual font usage (<a:rPr>) and colors 3. **Search for patterns**: Use grep to find color (<a:solidFill>, <a:srgbClr>) and font references across all XML files ## Creating a new PowerPoint presentation **without a template** When creating a new PowerPoint presentation from scratch, use the **html2pptx** workflow to convert HTML slides to PowerPoint with accurate positioning. ### Design Principles **CRITICAL**: Before creating any presentation, analyze the content and choose appropriate design elements: 1. **Consider the subject matter**: What is this presentation about? What tone, industry, or mood does it suggest? 2. **Check for branding**: If the user mentions a company/organization, consider their brand colors and identity 3. **Match palette to content**: Select colors that reflect the subject 4. **State your approach**: Explain your design choices before writing code **Requirements**: - \u2705 State your content-informed design approach BEFORE writing code - \u2705 Use web-safe fonts only: Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman, Georgia, Courier New, Verdana, Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, Impact - \u2705 Create clear visual hierarchy through size, weight, and color - \u2705 Ensure readability: strong contrast, appropriately sized text, clean alignment - \u2705 Be consistent: repeat patterns, spacing, and visual language across slides #### Color Palette Selection **Choosing colors creatively**: - **Think beyond defaults**: What colors genuinely match this specific topic? Avoid autopilot choices. - **Consider multiple angles**: Topic, industry, mood, energy level, target audience, brand identity (if mentioned) - **Be adventurous**: Try unexpected combinations - a healthcare presentation doesn't have to be green, finance doesn't have to be navy - **Build your palette**: Pick 3-5 colors that work together (dominant colors + supporting tones + accent) - **Ensure contrast**: Text must be clearly readable on backgrounds **Example color palettes** (use these to spark creativity - choose one, adapt it, or create your own): 1. **Classic Blue**: Deep navy (#1C2833), slate gray (#2E4053), silver (#AAB7B8), off-white (#F4F6F6) 2. **Teal & Coral**: Teal (#5EA8A7), deep teal (#277884), coral (#FE4447), white (#FFFFFF) 3. **Bold Red**: Red (#C0392B), bright red (#E74C3C), orange (#F39C12), yellow (#F1C40F), green (#2ECC71) 4. **Warm Blush**: Mauve (#A49393), blush (#EED6D3), rose (#E8B4B8), cream (#FAF7F2) 5. **Burgundy Luxury**: Burgundy (#5D1D2E), crimson (#951233), rust (#C15937), gold (#997929) 6. **Deep Purple & Emerald**: Purple (#B165FB), dark blue (#181B24), emerald (#40695B), white (#FFFFFF) 7. **Cream & Forest Green**: Cream (#FFE1C7), forest green (#40695B), white (#FCFCFC) 8. **Pink & Purple**: Pink (#F8275B), coral (#FF574A), rose (#FF737D), purple (#3D2F68) 9. **Lime & Plum**: Lime (#C5DE82), plum (#7C3A5F), coral (#FD8C6E), blue-gray (#98ACB5) 10. **Black & Gold**: Gold (#BF9A4A), black (#000000), cream (#F4F6F6) 11. **Sage & Terracotta**: Sage (#87A96B), terracotta (#E07A5F), cream (#F4F1DE), charcoal (#2C2C2C) 12. **Charcoal & Red**: Charcoal (#292929), red (#E33737), light gray (#CCCBCB) 13. **Vibrant Orange**: Orange (#F96D00), light gray (#F2F2F2), charcoal (#222831) 14. **Forest Green**: Black (#191A19), green (#4E9F3D), dark green (#1E5128), white (#FFFFFF) 15. **Retro Rainbow**: Purple (#722880), pink (#D72D51), orange (#EB5C18), amber (#F08800), gold (#DEB600) 16. **Vintage Earthy**: Mustard (#E3B448), sage (#CBD18F), forest green (#3A6B35), cream (#F4F1DE) 17. **Coastal Rose**: Old rose (#AD7670), beaver (#B49886), eggshell (#F3ECDC), ash gray (#BFD5BE) 18. **Orange & Turquoise**: Light orange (#FC993E), grayish turquoise (#667C6F), white (#FCFCFC) #### Visual Details Options **Geometric Patterns**: - Diagonal section dividers instead of horizontal - Asymmetric column widths (30/70, 40/60, 25/75) - Rotated text headers at 90\u00b0 or 270\u00b0 - Circular/hexagonal frames for images - Triangular accent shapes in corners - Overlapping shapes for depth **Border & Frame Treatments**: - Thick single-color borders (10-20pt) on one side only - Double-line borders with contrasting colors - Corner brackets instead of full frames - L-shaped borders (top+left or bottom+right) - Underline accents beneath headers (3-5pt thick) **Typography Treatments**: - Extreme size contrast (72pt headlines vs 11pt body) - All-caps headers with wide letter spacing - Numbered sections in oversized display type - Monospace (Courier New) for data/stats/technical content - Condensed fonts (Arial Narrow) for dense information - Outlined text for emphasis **Chart & Data Styling**: - Monochrome charts with single accent color for key data - Horizontal bar charts instead of vertical - Dot plots instead of bar charts - Minimal gridlines or none at all - Data labels directly on elements (no legends) - Oversized numbers for key metrics **Layout Innovations**: - Full-bleed images with text overlays - Sidebar column (20-30% width) for navigation/context - Modular grid systems (3\u00d73, 4\u00d74 blocks) - Z-pattern or F-pattern content flow - Floating text boxes over colored shapes - Magazine-style multi-column layouts **Background Treatments**: - Solid color blocks occupying 40-60% of slide - Gradient fills (vertical or diagonal only) - Split backgrounds (two colors, diagonal or vertical) - Edge-to-edge color bands - Negative space as a design element ### Layout Tips **When creating slides with charts or tables:** - **Two-column layout (PREFERRED)**: Use a header spanning the full width, then two columns below - text/bullets in one column and the featured content in the other. This provides better balance and makes charts/tables more readable. Use flexbox with unequal column widths (e.g., 40%/60% split) to optimize space for each content type. - **Full-slide layout**: Let the featured content (chart/table) take up the entire slide for maximum impact and readability - **NEVER vertically stack**: Do not place charts/tables below text in a single column - this causes poor readability and layout issues ### Workflow 1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [html2pptx.md](html2pptx.md) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Read the full file content for detailed syntax, critical formatting rules, and best practices before proceeding with presentation creation. 2. Create an HTML file for each slide with proper dimensions (e.g., 720pt \u00d7 405pt for 16:9) - Use <p>, <h1>-<h6>, <ul>, <ol> for all text content - Use class=\"placeholder\" for areas where charts/tables will be added (render with gray background for visibility) - **CRITICAL**: Rasterize gradients and icons as PNG images FIRST using Sharp, then reference in HTML - **LAYOUT**: For slides with charts/tables/images, use either full-slide layout or two-column layout for better readability 3. Create and run a JavaScript file using the [html2pptx.js](scripts/html2pptx.js) library to convert HTML slides to PowerPoint and save the presentation - Use the html2pptx() function to process each HTML file - Add charts and tables to placeholder areas using PptxGenJS API - Save the presentation using pptx.writeFile() 4. **Visual validation**: Generate thumbnails and inspect for layout issues - Create thumbnail grid: python scripts/thumbnail.py output.pptx workspace/thumbnails --cols 4 - Read and carefully examine the thumbnail image for: - **Text cutoff**: Text being cut off by header bars, shapes, or slide edges - **Text overlap**: Text overlapping with other text or shapes - **Positioning issues**: Content too close to slide boundaries or other elements - **Contrast issues**: Insufficient contrast between text and backgrounds - If issues found, adjust HTML margins/spacing/colors and regenerate the presentation - Repeat until all slides are visually correct ## Editing an existing PowerPoint presentation When edit slides in an existing PowerPoint presentation, you need to work with the raw Office Open XML (OOXML) format. This involves unpacking the .pptx file, editing the XML content, and repacking it. ### Workflow 1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [ooxml.md](ooxml.md) (~500 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Read the full file content for detailed guidance on OOXML structure and editing workflows before any presentation editing. 2. Unpack the presentation: python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_dir> 3. Edit the XML files (primarily ppt/slides/slide{N}.xml and related files) 4. **CRITICAL**: Validate immediately after each edit and fix any validation errors before proceeding: python ooxml/scripts/validate.py <dir> --original <file> 5. Pack the final presentation: python ooxml/scripts/pack.py <input_directory> <office_file> ## Creating a new PowerPoint presentation **using a template** When you need to create a presentation that follows an existing template's design, you'll need to duplicate and re-arrange template slides before then replacing placeholder context. ### Workflow 1. **Extract template text AND create visual thumbnail grid**: * Extract text: python -m markitdown template.pptx > template-content.md * Read template-content.md: Read the entire file to understand the contents of the template presentation. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** * Create thumbnail grids: python scripts/thumbnail.py template.pptx * See [Creating Thumbnail Grids](#creating-thumbnail-grids) section for more details 2. **Analyze template and save inventory to a file**: * **Visual Analysis**: Review thumbnail grid(s) to understand slide layouts, design patterns, and visual structure * Create and save a template inventory file at template-inventory.md containing: * **Using the thumbnail grid**: Reference the visual thumbnails to identify: - Layout patterns (title slides, content layouts, section dividers) - Image placeholder locations and counts - Design consistency across slide groups - Visual hierarchy and structure * This inventory file is REQUIRED for selecting appropriate templates in the next step 3. **Create presentation outline based on template inventory**: * Review available templates from step 2. * Choose an intro or title template for the first slide. This should be one of the first templates. * Choose safe, text-based layouts for the other slides. * **CRITICAL: Match layout structure to actual content**: - Single-column layouts: Use for unified narrative or single topic - Two-column layouts: Use ONLY when you have exactly 2 distinct items/concepts - Three-column layouts: Use ONLY when you have exactly 3 distinct items/concepts - Image + text layouts: Use ONLY when you have actual images to insert - Quote layouts: Use ONLY for actual quotes from people (with attribution), never for emphasis - Never use layouts with more placeholders than you have content - If you have 2 items, don't force them into a 3-column layout - If you have 4+ items, consider breaking into multiple slides or using a list format * Count your actual content pieces BEFORE selecting the layout * Verify each placeholder in the chosen layout will be filled with meaningful content * Select one option representing the **best** layout for each content section. * Save outline.md with content AND template mapping that leverages available designs * Example template mapping: 4. **Duplicate, reorder, and delete slides using rearrange.py**: * Use the scripts/rearrange.py script to create a new presentation with slides in the desired order: * The script handles duplicating repeated slides, deleting unused slides, and reordering automatically * Slide indices are 0-based (first slide is 0, second is 1, etc.) * The same slide index can appear multiple times to duplicate that slide 5. **Extract ALL text using the inventory.py script**: * **Run inventory extraction**: * **Read text-inventory.json**: Read the entire text-inventory.json file to understand all shapes and their properties. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** * The inventory JSON structure: * Key features: - **Slides**: Named as \"slide-0\", \"slide-1\", etc. - **Shapes**: Ordered by visual position (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) as \"shape-0\", \"shape-1\", etc. - **Placeholder types**: TITLE, CENTER_TITLE, SUBTITLE, BODY, OBJECT, or null - **Default font size**: default_font_size in points extracted from layout placeholders (when available) - **Slide numbers are filtered**: Shapes with SLIDE_NUMBER placeholder type are automatically excluded from inventory - **Bullets**: When bullet: true, level is always included (even if 0) - **Spacing**: space_before, space_after, and line_spacing in points (only included when set) - **Colors**: color for RGB (e.g., \"FF0000\"), theme_color for theme colors (e.g., \"DARK_1\") - **Properties**: Only non-default values are included in the output 6. **Generate replacement text and save the data to a JSON file** Based on the text inventory from the previous step: - **CRITICAL**: First verify which shapes exist in the inventory - only reference shapes that are actually present - **VALIDATION**: The replace.py script will validate that all shapes in your replacement JSON exist in the inventory - If you reference a non-existent shape, you'll get an error showing available shapes - If you reference a non-existent slide, you'll get an error indicating the slide doesn't exist - All validation errors are shown at once before the script exits - **IMPORTANT**: The replace.py script uses inventory.py internally to identify ALL text shapes - **AUTOMATIC CLEARING**: ALL text shapes from the inventory will be cleared unless you provide \"paragraphs\" for them - Add a \"paragraphs\" field to shapes that need content (not \"replacement_paragraphs\") - Shapes without \"paragraphs\" in the replacement JSON will have their text cleared automatically - Paragraphs with bullets will be automatically left aligned. Don't set the alignment property on when \"bullet\": true - Generate appropriate replacement content for placeholder text - Use shape size to determine appropriate content length - **CRITICAL**: Include paragraph properties from the original inventory - don't just provide text - **IMPORTANT**: When bullet: true, do NOT include bullet symbols (\u2022, -, *) in text - they're added automatically - **ESSENTIAL FORMATTING RULES**: - Headers/titles should typically have \"bold\": true - List items should have \"bullet\": true, \"level\": 0 (level is required when bullet is true) - Preserve any alignment properties (e.g., \"alignment\": \"CENTER\" for centered text) - Include font properties when different from default (e.g., \"font_size\": 14.0, \"font_name\": \"Lora\") - Colors: Use \"color\": \"FF0000\" for RGB or \"theme_color\": \"DARK_1\" for theme colors - The replacement script expects **properly formatted paragraphs**, not just text strings - **Overlapping shapes**: Prefer shapes with larger default_font_size or more appropriate placeholder_type - Save the updated inventory with replacements to replacement-text.json - **WARNING**: Different template layouts have different shape counts - always check the actual inventory before creating replacements Example paragraphs field showing proper formatting: **Shapes not listed in the replacement JSON are automatically cleared**: **Common formatting patterns for presentations**: - Title slides: Bold text, sometimes centered - Section headers within slides: Bold text - Bullet lists: Each item needs \"bullet\": true, \"level\": 0 - Body text: Usually no special properties needed - Quotes: May have special alignment or font properties 7. **Apply replacements using the replace.py script** The script will: - First extract the inventory of ALL text shapes using functions from inventory.py - Validate that all shapes in the replacement JSON exist in the inventory - Clear text from ALL shapes identified in the inventory - Apply new text only to shapes with \"paragraphs\" defined in the replacement JSON - Preserve formatting by applying paragraph properties from the JSON - Handle bullets, alignment, font properties, and colors automatically - Save the updated presentation Example validation errors: ## Creating Thumbnail Grids To create visual thumbnail grids of PowerPoint slides for quick analysis and reference: **Features**: - Creates: thumbnails.jpg (or thumbnails-1.jpg, thumbnails-2.jpg, etc. for large decks) - Default: 5 columns, max 30 slides per grid (5\u00d76) - Custom prefix: python scripts/thumbnail.py template.pptx my-grid - Note: The output prefix should include the path if you want output in a specific directory (e.g., workspace/my-grid) - Adjust columns: --cols 4 (range: 3-6, affects slides per grid) - Grid limits: 3 cols = 12 slides/grid, 4 cols = 20, 5 cols = 30, 6 cols = 42 - Slides are zero-indexed (Slide 0, Slide 1, etc.) **Use cases**: - Template analysis: Quickly understand slide layouts and design patterns - Content review: Visual overview of entire presentation - Navigation reference: Find specific slides by their visual appearance - Quality check: Verify all slides are properly formatted **Examples**: ## Converting Slides to Images To visually analyze PowerPoint slides, convert them to images using a two-step process: 1. **Convert PPTX to PDF**: 2. **Convert PDF pages to JPEG images**: This creates files like slide-1.jpg, slide-2.jpg, etc. Options: - -r 150: Sets resolution to 150 DPI (adjust for quality/size balance) - -jpeg: Output JPEG format (use -png for PNG if preferred) - -f N: First page to convert (e.g., -f 2 starts from page 2) - -l N: Last page to convert (e.g., -l 5 stops at page 5) - slide: Prefix for output files Example for specific range: ## Code Style Guidelines **IMPORTANT**: When generating code for PPTX operations: - Write concise code - Avoid verbose variable names and redundant operations - Avoid unnecessary print statements ## Dependencies Required dependencies (should already be installed): - **markitdown**: pip install \"markitdown[pptx]\" (for text extraction from presentations) - **pptxgenjs**: npm install -g pptxgenjs (for creating presentations via html2pptx) - **playwright**: npm install -g playwright (for HTML rendering in html2pptx) - **react-icons**: npm install -g react-icons react react-dom (for icons) - **sharp**: npm install -g sharp (for SVG rasterization and image processing) - **LibreOffice**: sudo apt-get install libreoffice (for PDF conversion) - **Poppler**: sudo apt-get install poppler-utils (for pdftoppm to convert PDF to images) - **defusedxml**: pip install defusedxml (for secure XML parsing)", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "pptx-official", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\pptx-official\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}
{"id": "skill_pricingstrategy_skill", "text": "--- name: pricing-strategy description: \"When the user wants help with pricing decisions, packaging, or monetization strategy. Also use when the user mentions 'pricing,' 'pricing tiers,' 'freemium,' 'free trial,' 'packaging,' 'price increase,' 'value metric,' 'Van Westendorp,' 'willingness to pay,' or 'monetization.' This skill covers pricing research, tier structure, and packaging strategy.\" --- # Pricing Strategy You are an expert in SaaS pricing and monetization strategy with access to pricing research data and analysis tools. Your goal is to help design pricing that captures value, drives growth, and aligns with customer willingness to pay. ## Before Starting Gather this context (ask if not provided): ### 1. Business Context - What type of product? (SaaS, marketplace, e-commerce, service) - What's your current pricing (if any)? - What's your target market? (SMB, mid-market, enterprise) - What's your go-to-market motion? (self-serve, sales-led, hybrid) ### 2. Value & Competition - What's the primary value you deliver? - What alternatives do customers consider? - How do competitors price? - What makes you different/better? ### 3. Current Performance - What's your current conversion rate? - What's your average revenue per user (ARPU)? - What's your churn rate? - Any feedback on pricing from customers/prospects? ### 4. Goals - Are you optimizing for growth, revenue, or profitability? - Are you trying to move upmarket or expand downmarket? - Any pricing changes you're considering? --- ## Pricing Fundamentals ### The Three Pricing Axes Every pricing decision involves three dimensions: **1. Packaging** \u2014 What's included at each tier? - Features, limits, support level - How tiers differ from each other **2. Pricing Metric** \u2014 What do you charge for? - Per user, per usage, flat fee - How price scales with value **3. Price Point** \u2014 How much do you charge? - The actual dollar amounts - The perceived value vs. cost ### Value-Based Pricing Framework Price should be based on value delivered, not cost to serve: **Key insight:** Price between the next best alternative and perceived value. Cost is a floor, not a basis. --- ## Pricing Research Methods ### Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter The Van Westendorp survey identifies the acceptable price range for your product. **The Four Questions:** Ask each respondent: 1. \"At what price would you consider [product] to be so expensive that you would not consider buying it?\" (Too expensive) 2. \"At what price would you consider [product] to be priced so low that you would question its quality?\" (Too cheap) 3. \"At what price would you consider [product] to be starting to get expensive, but you still might consider it?\" (Expensive/high side) 4. \"At what price would you consider [product] to be a bargain\u2014a great buy for the money?\" (Cheap/good value) **How to Analyze:** 1. Plot cumulative distributions for each question 2. Find the intersections: - **Point of Marginal Cheapness (PMC):** \"Too cheap\" crosses \"Expensive\" - **Point of Marginal Expensiveness (PME):** \"Too expensive\" crosses \"Cheap\" - **Optimal Price Point (OPP):** \"Too cheap\" crosses \"Too expensive\" - **Indifference Price Point (IDP):** \"Expensive\" crosses \"Cheap\" **The acceptable price range:** PMC to PME **Optimal pricing zone:** Between OPP and IDP **Survey Tips:** - Need 100-300 respondents for reliable data - Segment by persona (different willingness to pay) - Use realistic product descriptions - Consider adding purchase intent questions **Sample Van Westendorp Analysis Output:** ### MaxDiff Analysis (Best-Worst Scaling) MaxDiff identifies which features customers value most, informing packaging decisions. **How It Works:** 1. List 8-15 features you could include 2. Show respondents sets of 4-5 features at a time 3. Ask: \"Which is MOST important? Which is LEAST important?\" 4. Repeat across multiple sets until all features compared 5. Statistical analysis produces importance scores **Example Survey Question:** **Analyzing Results:** Features are ranked by utility score: - High utility = Must-have (include in base tier) - Medium utility = Differentiator (use for tier separation) - Low utility = Nice-to-have (premium tier or cut) **Using MaxDiff for Packaging:** | Utility Score | Packaging Decision | |---------------|-------------------| | Top 20% | Include in all tiers (table stakes) | | 20-50% | Use to differentiate tiers | | 50-80% | Higher tiers only | | Bottom 20% | Consider cutting or premium add-on | ### Willingness to Pay Surveys **Direct method (simple but biased):** \"How much would you pay for [product]?\" **Better: Gabor-Granger method:** \"Would you buy [product] at [$X]?\" (Yes/No) Vary price across respondents to build demand curve. **Even better: Conjoint analysis:** Show product bundles at different prices Respondents choose preferred option Statistical analysis reveals price sensitivity per feature --- ## Value Metrics ### What is a Value Metric? The value metric is what you charge for\u2014it should scale with the value customers receive. **Good value metrics:** - Align price with value delivered - Are easy to understand - Scale as customer grows - Are hard to game ### Common Value Metrics | Metric | Best For | Example | |--------|----------|---------| | Per user/seat | Collaboration tools | Slack, Notion | | Per usage | Variable consumption | AWS, Twilio | | Per feature | Modular products | HubSpot add-ons | | Per contact/record | CRM, email tools | Mailchimp, HubSpot | | Per transaction | Payments, marketplaces | Stripe, Shopify | | Flat fee | Simple products | Basecamp | | Revenue share | High-value outcomes | Affiliate platforms | ### Choosing Your Value Metric **Step 1: Identify how customers get value** - What outcome do they care about? - What do they measure success by? - What would they pay more for? **Step 2: Map usage to value** | Usage Pattern | Value Delivered | Potential Metric | |---------------|-----------------|------------------| | More team members use it | More collaboration value | Per user | | More data processed | More insights | Per record/event | | More revenue generated | Direct ROI | Revenue share | | More projects managed | More organization | Per project | **Step 3: Test for alignment** Ask: \"As a customer uses more of [metric], do they get more value?\" - If yes \u2192 good value metric - If no \u2192 price doesn't align with value ### Mapping Usage to Value: Framework **1. Instrument usage data** Track how customers use your product: - Feature usage frequency - Volume metrics (users, records, API calls) - Outcome metrics (revenue generated, time saved) **2. Correlate with customer success** - Which usage patterns predict retention? - Which usage patterns predict expansion? - Which customers pay the most, and why? **3. Identify value thresholds** - At what usage level do customers \"get it\"? - At what usage level do they expand? - At what usage level should price increase? **Example Analysis:** --- ## Tier Structure ### How Many Tiers? **2 tiers:** Simple, clear choice - Works for: Clear SMB vs. Enterprise split - Risk: May leave money on table **3 tiers:** Industry standard - Good tier = Entry point - Better tier = Recommended (anchor to best) - Best tier = High-value customers **4+ tiers:** More granularity - Works for: Wide range of customer sizes - Risk: Decision paralysis, complexity ### Good-Better-Best Framework **Good tier (Entry):** - Purpose: Remove barriers to entry - Includes: Core features, limited usage - Price: Low, accessible - Target: Small teams, try before you buy **Better tier (Recommended):** - Purpose: Where most customers land - Includes: Full features, reasonable limits - Price: Your \"anchor\" price - Target: Growing teams, serious users **Best tier (Premium):** - Purpose: Capture high-value customers - Includes: Everything, advanced features, higher limits - Price: Premium (often 2-3x \"Better\") - Target: Larger teams, power users, enterprises ### Tier Differentiation Strategies **Feature gating:** - Basic features in all tiers - Advanced features in higher tiers - Works when features have clear value differences **Usage limits:** - Same features, different limits - More users, storage, API calls at higher tiers - Works when value scales with usage **Support level:** - Email support \u2192 Priority support \u2192 Dedicated success - Works for products with implementation complexity **Access and customization:** - API access, SSO, custom branding - Works for enterprise differentiation ### Example Tier Structure --- ## Packaging for Personas ### Identifying Pricing Personas Different customers have different: - Willingness to pay - Feature needs - Buying processes - Value perception **Segment by:** - Company size (solopreneur \u2192 SMB \u2192 enterprise) - Use case (marketing vs. sales vs. support) - Sophistication (beginner \u2192 power user) - Industry (different budget norms) ### Persona-Based Packaging **Step 1: Define personas** | Persona | Size | Needs | WTP | Example | |---------|------|-------|-----|---------| | Freelancer | 1 person | Basic features | Low | $19/mo | | Small Team | 2-10 | Collaboration | Medium | $49/mo | | Growing Co | 10-50 | Scale, integrations | Higher | $149/mo | | Enterprise | 50+ | Security, support | High | Custom | **Step 2: Map features to personas** | Feature | Freelancer | Small Team | Growing | Enterprise | |---------|------------|------------|---------|------------| | Core features | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 | | Collaboration | \u2014 | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 | | Integrations | \u2014 | Limited | Full | Full | | API access | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2713 | \u2713 | | SSO/SAML | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2713 | | Audit logs | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2713 | | Custom contract | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2713 | **Step 3: Price to value for each persona** - Research willingness to pay per segment - Set prices that capture value without blocking adoption - Consider segment-specific landing pages --- ## Freemium vs. Free Trial ### When to Use Freemium **Freemium works when:** - Product has viral/network effects - Free users provide value (content, data, referrals) - Large market where % conversion drives volume - Low marginal cost to serve free users - Clear feature/usage limits for upgrade trigger **Freemium risks:** - Free users may never convert - Devalues product perception - Support costs for non-paying users - Harder to raise prices later **Example: Slack** - Free tier for small teams - Message history limit creates upgrade trigger - Free users invite others (viral growth) - Converts when team hits limit ### When to Use Free Trial **Free trial works when:** - Product needs time to demonstrate value - Onboarding/setup investment required - B2B with buying committees - Higher price points - Product is \"sticky\" once configured **Trial best practices:** - 7-14 days for simple products - 14-30 days for complex products - Full access (not feature-limited) - Clear countdown and reminders - Credit card optional vs. required trade-off **Credit card upfront:** - Higher trial-to-paid conversion (40-50% vs. 15-25%) - Lower trial volume - Better qualified leads ### Hybrid Approaches **Freemium + Trial:** - Free tier with limited features - Trial of premium features - Example: Zoom (free 40-min, trial of Pro) **Reverse trial:** - Start with full access - After trial, downgrade to free tier - Example: See premium value, live with limitations until ready --- ## When to Raise Prices ### Signs It's Time **Market signals:** - Competitors have raised prices - You're significantly cheaper than alternatives - Prospects don't flinch at price - \"It's so cheap!\" feedback **Business signals:** - Very high conversion rates (>40%) - Very low churn (<3% monthly) - Customers using more than they pay for - Unit economics are strong **Product signals:** - You've added significant value since last pricing - Product is more mature/stable - New features justify higher price ### Price Increase Strategies **1. Grandfather existing customers** - New price for new customers only - Existing customers keep old price - Pro: No churn risk - Con: Leaves money on table, creates complexity **2. Delayed increase for existing** - Announce increase 3-6 months out - Give time to lock in old price (annual) - Pro: Fair, drives annual conversions - Con: Some churn, requires communication **3. Increase tied to value** - Raise price but add features - \"New Pro tier with X, Y, Z\" - Pro: Justified increase - Con: Requires actual new value **4. Plan restructure** - Change plans entirely - Existing customers mapped to nearest fit - Pro: Clean slate - Con: Disruptive, requires careful mapping ### Communicating Price Increases **For new customers:** - Just update pricing page - No announcement needed - Monitor conversion rate **For existing customers:** --- ## Pricing Page Best Practices ### Above the Fold - Clear tier comparison table - Recommended tier highlighted - Monthly/annual toggle - Primary CTA for each tier ### Tier Presentation - Lead with the recommended tier (visual emphasis) - Show value progression clearly - Use checkmarks and limits, not paragraphs - Anchor to higher tier (show enterprise first or savings) ### Common Elements - [ ] Feature comparison table - [ ] Who each tier is for - [ ] FAQ section - [ ] Contact sales option - [ ] Annual discount callout - [ ] Money-back guarantee - [ ] Customer logos/trust signals ### Pricing Psychology to Apply - **Anchoring:** Show higher-priced option first - **Decoy effect:** Middle tier should be obviously best value - **Charm pricing:** $49 vs. $50 (for value-focused) - **Round pricing:** $50 vs. $49 (for premium) - **Annual savings:** Show monthly price but offer annual discount (17-20%) --- ## Price Testing ### Methods for Testing Price **1. A/B test pricing page (risky)** - Different visitors see different prices - Ethical/legal concerns - May damage trust if discovered **2. Geographic testing** - Test higher prices in new markets - Different currencies/regions - Cleaner test, limited reach **3. New customer only** - Raise prices for new customers - Compare conversion rates - Monitor cohort LTV **4. Sales team discretion** - Test higher quotes through sales - Track close rates at different prices - Works for sales-led GTM **5. Feature-based testing** - Test different packaging - Add premium tier at higher price - See adoption without changing existing ### What to Measure - Conversion rate at each price point - Average revenue per user (ARPU) - Total revenue (conversion \u00d7 price) - Customer lifetime value - Churn rate by price paid - Price sensitivity by segment --- ## Enterprise Pricing ### When to Add Custom Pricing Add \"Contact Sales\" when: - Deal sizes exceed $10k+ ARR - Customers need custom contracts - Implementation/onboarding required - Security/compliance requirements - Procurement processes involved ### Enterprise Tier Elements **Table stakes:** - SSO/SAML - Audit logs - Admin controls - Uptime SLA - Security certifications **Value-adds:** - Dedicated support/success - Custom onboarding - Training sessions - Custom integrations - Priority roadmap input ### Enterprise Pricing Strategies **Per-seat at scale:** - Volume discounts for large teams - Example: $15/user (standard) \u2192 $10/user (100+) **Platform fee + usage:** - Base fee for access - Usage-based above thresholds - Example: $500/mo base + $0.01 per API call **Value-based contracts:** - Price tied to customer's revenue/outcomes - Example: % of transactions, revenue share --- ## Pricing Checklist ### Before Setting Prices - [ ] Defined target customer personas - [ ] Researched competitor pricing - [ ] Identified your value metric - [ ] Conducted willingness-to-pay research - [ ] Mapped features to tiers ### Pricing Structure - [ ] Chosen number of tiers - [ ] Differentiated tiers clearly - [ ] Set price points based on research - [ ] Created annual discount strategy - [ ] Planned enterprise/custom tier ### Validation - [ ] Tested pricing with target customers - [ ] Reviewed pricing with sales team - [ ] Validated unit economics work - [ ] Planned for price increases - [ ] Set up tracking for pricing metrics --- ## Questions to Ask If you need more context: 1. What pricing research have you done (surveys, competitor analysis)? 2. What's your current ARPU and conversion rate? 3. What's your primary value metric (what do customers pay for value)? 4. Who are your main pricing personas (by size, use case)? 5. Are you self-serve, sales-led, or hybrid? 6. What pricing changes are you considering? --- ## Related Skills - **page-cro**: For optimizing pricing page conversion - **copywriting**: For pricing page copy - **marketing-psychology**: For pricing psychology principles - **ab-test-setup**: For testing pricing changes - **analytics-tracking**: For tracking pricing metrics", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "pricing-strategy", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\pricing-strategy\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

{"id": "skill_programmaticseo_skill", "text": "--- name: programmatic-seo description: When the user wants to create SEO-driven pages at scale using templates and data. Also use when the user mentions \"programmatic SEO,\" \"template pages,\" \"pages at scale,\" \"directory pages,\" \"location pages,\" \"[keyword] + [city] pages,\" \"comparison pages,\" \"integration pages,\" or \"building many pages for SEO.\" For auditing existing SEO issues, see seo-audit. --- # Programmatic SEO You are an expert in programmatic SEO\u2014building SEO-optimized pages at scale using templates and data. Your goal is to create pages that rank, provide value, and avoid thin content penalties. ## Initial Assessment Before designing a programmatic SEO strategy, understand: 1. **Business Context** - What's the product/service? - Who is the target audience? - What's the conversion goal for these pages? 2. **Opportunity Assessment** - What search patterns exist? - How many potential pages? - What's the search volume distribution? 3. **Competitive Landscape** - Who ranks for these terms now? - What do their pages look like? - What would it take to beat them? --- ## Core Principles ### 1. Unique Value Per Page Every page must provide value specific to that page: - Unique data, insights, or combinations - Not just swapped variables in a template - Maximize unique content\u2014the more differentiated, the better - Avoid \"thin content\" penalties by adding real depth ### 2. Proprietary Data Wins The best pSEO uses data competitors can't easily replicate: - **Proprietary data**: Data you own or generate - **Product-derived data**: Insights from your product usage - **User-generated content**: Reviews, comments, submissions - **Aggregated insights**: Unique analysis of public data Hierarchy of data defensibility: 1. Proprietary (you created it) 2. Product-derived (from your users) 3. User-generated (your community) 4. Licensed (exclusive access) 5. Public (anyone can use\u2014weakest) ### 3. Clean URL Structure **Always use subfolders, not subdomains**: - Good: yoursite.com/templates/resume/ - Bad: templates.yoursite.com/resume/ Subfolders pass authority to your main domain. Subdomains are treated as separate sites by Google. **URL best practices**: - Short, descriptive, keyword-rich - Consistent pattern across page type - No unnecessary parameters - Human-readable slugs ### 4. Genuine Search Intent Match Pages must actually answer what people are searching for: - Understand the intent behind each pattern - Provide the complete answer - Don't over-optimize for keywords at expense of usefulness ### 5. Scalable Quality, Not Just Quantity - Quality standards must be maintained at scale - Better to have 100 great pages than 10,000 thin ones - Build quality checks into the process ### 6. Avoid Google Penalties - No doorway pages (thin pages that just funnel to main site) - No keyword stuffing - No duplicate content across pages - Genuine utility for users --- ## The 12 Programmatic SEO Playbooks Beyond mixing and matching data point permutations, these are the proven playbooks for programmatic SEO: ### 1.

{"id": "skill_promptengineering_skill", "text": "--- name: prompt-engineering description: Expert guide on prompt engineering patterns, best practices, and optimization techniques. Use when user wants to improve prompts, learn prompting strategies, or debug agent behavior. --- # Prompt Engineering Patterns Advanced prompt engineering techniques to maximize LLM performance, reliability, and controllability. ## Core Capabilities ### 1. Few-Shot Learning Teach the model by showing examples instead of explaining rules. Include 2-5 input-output pairs that demonstrate the desired behavior. Use when you need consistent formatting, specific reasoning patterns, or handling of edge cases. More examples improve accuracy but consume tokens\u2014balance based on task complexity. **Example:** ### 2. Chain-of-Thought Prompting Request step-by-step reasoning before the final answer. Add \"Let's think step by step\" (zero-shot) or include example reasoning traces (few-shot). Use for complex problems requiring multi-step logic, mathematical reasoning, or when you need to verify the model's thought process. Improves accuracy on analytical tasks by 30-50%. **Example:** ### 3. Prompt Optimization Systematically improve prompts through testing and refinement. Start simple, measure performance (accuracy, consistency, token usage), then iterate. Test on diverse inputs including edge cases. Use A/B testing to compare variations. Critical for production prompts where consistency and cost matter. **Example:** ### 4. Template Systems Build reusable prompt structures with variables, conditional sections, and modular components. Use for multi-turn conversations, role-based interactions, or when the same pattern applies to different inputs. Reduces duplication and ensures consistency across similar tasks. **Example:** ### 5. System Prompt Design Set global behavior and constraints that persist across the conversation. Define the model's role, expertise level, output format, and safety guidelines. Use system prompts for stable instructions that shouldn't change turn-to-turn, freeing up user message tokens for variable content. **Example:** ## Key Patterns ### Progressive Disclosure Start with simple prompts, add complexity only when needed: 1. **Level 1**: Direct instruction - \"Summarize this article\" 2. **Level 2**: Add constraints - \"Summarize this article in 3 bullet points, focusing on key findings\" 3. **Level 3**: Add reasoning - \"Read this article, identify the main findings, then summarize in 3 bullet points\" 4. **Level 4**: Add examples - Include 2-3 example summaries with input-output pairs ### Instruction Hierarchy ### Error Recovery Build prompts that gracefully handle failures: - Include fallback instructions - Request confidence scores - Ask for alternative interpretations when uncertain - Specify how to indicate missing information ## Best Practices 1. **Be Specific**: Vague prompts produce inconsistent results 2. **Show, Don't Tell**: Examples are more effective than descriptions 3. **Test Extensively**: Evaluate on diverse, representative inputs 4. **Iterate Rapidly**: Small changes can have large impacts 5. **Monitor Performance**: Track metrics in production 6. **Version Control**: Treat prompts as code with proper versioning 7. **Document Intent**: Explain why prompts are structured as they are ## Common Pitfalls - **Over-engineering**: Starting with complex prompts before trying simple ones - **Example pollution**: Using examples that don't match the target task - **Context overflow**: Exceeding token limits with excessive examples - **Ambiguous instructions**: Leaving room for multiple interpretations - **Ignoring edge cases**: Not testing on unusual or boundary inputs", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "prompt-engineering", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\prompt-engineering\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

Eliminating Waterfalls **Impact: CRITICAL** Waterfalls are the #1 performance killer. Each sequential await adds full network latency. Eliminating them yields the largest gains. ### 1.1 Defer Await Until Needed **Impact: HIGH (avoids blocking unused code paths)** Move await operations into the branches where they're actually used to avoid blocking code paths that don't need them. **Incorrect: blocks both branches** **Correct: only blocks when needed** **Another example: early return optimization** This optimization is especially valuable when the skipped branch is frequently taken, or when the deferred operation is expensive. ### 1.2 Dependency-Based Parallelization **Impact: CRITICAL (2-10\u00d7 improvement)** For operations with partial dependencies, use better-all to maximize parallelism. It automatically starts each task at the earliest possible moment. **Incorrect: profile waits for config unnecessarily** **Correct: config and profile run in parallel** Reference: [https://github.com/shuding/better-all](https://github.com/shuding/better-all) ### 1.3 Prevent Waterfall Chains in API Routes **Impact: CRITICAL (2-10\u00d7 improvement)** In API routes and Server Actions, start independent operations immediately, even if you don't await them yet. **Incorrect: config waits for auth, data waits for both** **Correct: auth and config start immediately** For operations with more complex dependency chains, use better-all to automatically maximize parallelism (see Dependency-Based Parallelization). ### 1.4 Promise.all() for Independent Operations **Impact: CRITICAL (2-10\u00d7 improvement)** When async operations have no interdependencies, execute them concurrently using Promise.all(). **Incorrect: sequential execution, 3 round trips** **Correct: parallel execution, 1 round trip** ### 1.5 Strategic Suspense Boundaries **Impact: HIGH (faster initial paint)** Instead of awaiting data in async components before returning JSX, use Suspense boundaries to show the wrapper UI faster while data loads. **Incorrect: wrapper blocked by data fetching** The entire layout waits for data even though only the middle section needs it. **Correct: wrapper shows immediately, data streams in** Sidebar, Header, and Footer render immediately. Only DataDisplay waits for data. **Alternative: share promise across components** Both components share the same promise, so only one fetch occurs. Layout renders immediately while both components wait together. **When NOT to use this pattern:** - Critical data needed for layout decisions (affects positioning) - SEO-critical content above the fold - Small, fast queries where suspense overhead isn't worth it - When you want to avoid layout shift (loading \u2192 content jump) **Trade-off:** Faster initial paint vs potential layout shift. Choose based on your UX priorities. --- ## 2. Bundle Size Optimization **Impact: CRITICAL** Reducing initial bundle size improves Time to Interactive and Largest Contentful Paint. ### 2.1 Avoid Barrel File Imports **Impact: CRITICAL (200-800ms import cost, slow builds)** Import directly from source files instead of barrel files to avoid loading thousands of unused modules. **Barrel files** are entry points that re-export multiple modules (e.g., index.js that does export * from './module'). Popular icon and component libraries can have **up to 10,000 re-exports** in their entry file. For many React packages, **it takes 200-800ms just to import them**, affecting both development speed and production cold starts. **Why tree-shaking doesn't help:** When a library is marked as external (not bundled), the bundler can't optimize it. If you bundle it to enable tree-shaking, builds become substantially slower analyzing the entire module graph. **Incorrect: imports entire library** **Correct: imports only what you need** **Alternative: Next.js 13.5+** Direct imports provide 15-70% faster dev boot, 28% faster builds, 40% faster cold starts, and significantly faster HMR. Libraries commonly affected: lucide-react, @mui/material, @mui/icons-material, @tabler/icons-react, react-icons, @headlessui/react, @radix-ui/react-*, lodash, ramda, date-fns, rxjs, react-use. Reference: [https://vercel.com/blog/how-we-optimized-package-imports-in-next-js](https://vercel.com/blog/how-we-optimized-package-imports-in-next-js) ### 2.2 Conditional Module Loading **Impact: HIGH (loads large data only when needed)** Load large data or modules only when a feature is activated. **Example: lazy-load animation frames** The typeof window !== 'undefined' check prevents bundling this module for SSR, optimizing server bundle size and build speed. ### 2.3 Defer Non-Critical Third-Party Libraries **Impact: MEDIUM (loads after hydration)** Analytics, logging, and error tracking don't block user interaction. Load them after hydration. **Incorrect: blocks initial bundle** **Correct: loads after hydration** ### 2.4 Dynamic Imports for Heavy Components **Impact: CRITICAL (directly affects TTI and LCP)** Use next/dynamic to lazy-load large components not needed on initial render. **Incorrect: Monaco bundles with main chunk ~300KB** **Correct: Monaco loads on demand** ### 2.5 Preload Based on User Intent **Impact: MEDIUM (reduces perceived latency)** Preload heavy bundles before they're needed to reduce perceived latency. **Example: preload on hover/focus** **Example: preload when feature flag is enabled** The typeof window !== 'undefined' check prevents bundling preloaded modules for SSR, optimizing server bundle size and build speed. --- ## 3. Server-Side Performance **Impact: HIGH** Optimizing server-side rendering and data fetching eliminates server-side waterfalls and reduces response times. ### 3.1 Cross-Request LRU Caching **Impact: HIGH (caches across requests)** React.cache() only works within one request. For data shared across sequential requests (user clicks button A then button B), use an LRU cache. **Implementation:** Use when sequential user actions hit multiple endpoints needing the same data within seconds. **With Vercel's [Fluid Compute](https://vercel.com/docs/fluid-compute):** LRU caching is especially effective because multiple concurrent requests can share the same function instance and cache. This means the cache persists across requests without needing external storage like Redis. **In traditional serverless:** Each invocation runs in isolation, so consider Redis for cross-process caching. Reference: [https://github.com/isaacs/node-lru-cache](https://github.com/isaacs/node-lru-cache) ### 3.2 Minimize Serialization at RSC Boundaries **Impact: HIGH (reduces data transfer size)** The React Server/Client boundary serializes all object properties into strings and embeds them in the HTML response and subsequent RSC requests. This serialized data directly impacts page weight and load time, so **size matters a lot**. Only pass fields that the client actually uses. **Incorrect: serializes all 50 fields** **Correct: serializes only 1 field** ### 3.3 Parallel Data Fetching with Component Composition **Impact: CRITICAL (eliminates server-side waterfalls)** React Server Components execute sequentially within a tree. Restructure with composition to parallelize data fetching. **Incorrect: Sidebar waits for Page's fetch to complete** **Correct: both fetch simultaneously** **Alternative with children prop:** ### 3.4 Per-Request Deduplication with React.cache() **Impact: MEDIUM (deduplicates within request)** Use React.cache() for server-side request deduplication. Authentication and database queries benefit most. **Usage:** Within a single request, multiple calls to getCurrentUser() execute the query only once. ### 3.5 Use after() for Non-Blocking Operations **Impact: MEDIUM (faster response times)** Use Next.js's after() to schedule work that should execute after a response is sent. This prevents logging, analytics, and other side effects from blocking the response. **Incorrect: blocks response** **Correct: non-blocking** The response is sent immediately while logging happens in the background. **Common use cases:** - Analytics tracking - Audit logging - Sending notifications - Cache invalidation - Cleanup tasks **Important notes:** - after() runs even if the response fails or redirects - Works in Server Actions, Route Handlers, and Server Components Reference: [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/after](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/after) --- ## 4. Client-Side Data Fetching **Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH** Automatic deduplication and efficient data fetching patterns reduce redundant network requests. ### 4.1 Deduplicate Global Event Listeners **Impact: LOW (single listener for N components)** Use useSWRSubscription() to share global event listeners across component instances. **Incorrect: N instances = N listeners** When using the useKeyboardShortcut hook multiple times, each instance will register a new listener. **Correct: N instances = 1 listener** ### 4.2 Use SWR for Automatic Deduplication **Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH (automatic deduplication)** SWR enables request deduplication, caching, and revalidation across component instances. **Incorrect: no deduplication, each instance fetches** **Correct: multiple instances share one request** **For immutable data:** **For mutations:** Reference: [https://swr.vercel.app](https://swr.vercel.app) --- ## 5. Re-render Optimization **Impact: MEDIUM** Reducing unnecessary re-renders minimizes wasted computation and improves UI responsiveness. ### 5.1 Defer State Reads to Usage Point **Impact: MEDIUM (avoids unnecessary subscriptions)** Don't subscribe to dynamic state (searchParams, localStorage) if you only read it inside callbacks. **Incorrect: subscribes to all searchParams changes** **Correct: reads on demand, no subscription** ### 5.2 Extract to Memoized Components **Impact: MEDIUM (enables early returns)** Extract expensive work into memoized components to enable early returns before computation. **Incorrect: computes avatar even when loading** **Correct: skips computation when loading** **Note:** If your project has [React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) enabled, manual memoization with memo() and useMemo() is not necessary. The compiler automatically optimizes re-renders. ### 5.3 Narrow Effect Dependencies **Impact: LOW (minimizes effect re-runs)** Specify primitive dependencies instead of objects to minimize effect re-runs. **Incorrect: re-runs on any user field change** **Correct: re-runs only when id changes** **For derived state, compute outside effect:** ### 5.4 Subscribe to Derived State **Impact: MEDIUM (reduces re-render frequency)** Subscribe to derived boolean state instead of continuous values to reduce re-render frequency. **Incorrect: re-renders on every pixel change** **Correct: re-renders only when boolean changes** ### 5.5 Use Functional setState Updates **Impact: MEDIUM (prevents stale closures and unnecessary callback recreations)** When updating state based on the current state value, use the functional update form of setState instead of directly referencing the state variable. This prevents stale closures, eliminates unnecessary dependencies, and creates stable callback references. **Incorrect: requires state as dependency** The first callback is recreated every time items changes, which can cause child components to re-render unnecessarily. The second callback has a stale closure bug\u2014it will always reference the initial items value. **Correct: stable callbacks, no stale closures** **Benefits:** 1. **Stable callback references** - Callbacks don't need to be recreated when state changes 2. **No stale closures** - Always operates on the latest state value 3. **Fewer dependencies** - Simplifies dependency arrays and reduces memory leaks 4. **Prevents bugs** - Eliminates the most common source of React closure bugs **When to use functional updates:** - Any setState that depends on the current state value - Inside useCallback/useMemo when state is needed - Event handlers that reference state - Async operations that update state **When direct updates are fine:** - Setting state to a static value: setCount(0) - Setting state from props/arguments only: setName(newName) - State doesn't depend on previous value **Note:** If your project has [React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) enabled, the compiler can automatically optimize some cases, but functional updates are still recommended for correctness and to prevent stale closure bugs. ### 5.6 Use Lazy State Initialization **Impact: MEDIUM (wasted computation on every render)** Pass a function to useState for expensive initial values. Without the function form, the initializer runs on every render even though the value is only used once. **Incorrect: runs on every render** **Correct: runs only once** Use lazy initialization when computing initial values from localStorage/sessionStorage, building data structures (indexes, maps), reading from the DOM, or performing heavy transformations. For simple primitives (useState(0)), direct references (useState(props.value)), or cheap literals (useState({})), the function form is unnecessary. ### 5.7 Use Transitions for Non-Urgent Updates **Impact: MEDIUM (maintains UI responsiveness)** Mark frequent, non-urgent state updates as transitions to maintain UI responsiveness. **Incorrect: blocks UI on every scroll** **Correct: non-blocking updates** --- ## 6. Rendering Performance **Impact: MEDIUM** Optimizing the rendering process reduces the work the browser needs to do. ### 6.1 Animate SVG Wrapper Instead of SVG Element **Impact: LOW (enables hardware acceleration)** Many browsers don't have hardware acceleration for CSS3 animations on SVG elements. Wrap SVG in a <div> and animate the wrapper instead. **Incorrect: animating SVG directly - no hardware acceleration** **Correct: animating wrapper div - hardware accelerated** This applies to all CSS transforms and transitions (transform, opacity, translate, scale, rotate). The wrapper div allows browsers to use GPU acceleration for smoother animations. ### 6.2 CSS content-visibility for Long Lists **Impact: HIGH (faster initial render)** Apply content-visibility: auto to defer off-screen rendering. **CSS:** **Example:** For 1000 messages, browser skips layout/paint for ~990 off-screen items (10\u00d7 faster initial render). ### 6.3 Hoist Static JSX Elements **Impact: LOW (avoids re-creation)** Extract static JSX outside components to avoid re-creation. **Incorrect: recreates element every render** **Correct: reuses same element** This is especially helpful for large and static SVG nodes, which can be expensive to recreate on every render. **Note:** If your project has [React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) enabled, the compiler automatically hoists static JSX elements and optimizes component re-renders, making manual hoisting unnecessary. ### 6.4 Optimize SVG Precision **Impact: LOW (reduces file size)** Reduce SVG coordinate precision to decrease file size. The optimal precision depends on the viewBox size, but in general reducing precision should be considered. **Incorrect: excessive precision** **Correct: 1 decimal place** **Automate with SVGO:** ### 6.5 Prevent Hydration Mismatch Without Flickering **Impact: MEDIUM (avoids visual flicker and hydration errors)** When rendering content that depends on client-side storage (localStorage, cookies), avoid both SSR breakage and post-hydration flickering by injecting a synchronous script that updates the DOM before React hydrates. **Incorrect: breaks SSR** Server-side rendering will fail because localStorage is undefined. **Incorrect: visual flickering** Component first renders with default value (light), then updates after hydration, causing a visible flash of incorrect content. **Correct: no flicker, no hydration mismatch** The inline script executes synchronously before showing the element, ensuring the DOM already has the correct value. No flickering, no hydration mismatch. This pattern is especially useful for theme toggles, user preferences, authentication states, and any client-only data that should render immediately without flashing default values. ### 6.6 Use Activity Component for Show/Hide **Impact: MEDIUM (preserves state/DOM)** Use React's <Activity> to preserve state/DOM for expensive components that frequently toggle visibility. **Usage:** Avoids expensive re-renders and state loss. ### 6.7 Use Explicit Conditional Rendering **Impact: LOW (prevents rendering 0 or NaN)** Use explicit ternary operators (? :) instead of && for conditional rendering when the condition can be 0, NaN, or other falsy values that render. **Incorrect: renders \"0\" when count is 0** **Correct: renders nothing when count is 0** --- ## 7. JavaScript Performance **Impact: LOW-MEDIUM** Micro-optimizations for hot paths can add up to meaningful improvements. ### 7.1 Batch DOM CSS Changes **Impact: MEDIUM (reduces reflows/repaints)** Avoid changing styles one property at a time. Group multiple CSS changes together via classes or cssText to minimize browser reflows. **Incorrect: multiple reflows** **Correct: add class - single reflow** **Correct: change cssText - single reflow** **React example:** Prefer CSS classes over inline styles when possible. Classes are cached by the browser and provide better separation of concerns. ### 7.2 Build Index Maps for Repeated Lookups **Impact: LOW-MEDIUM (1M ops to 2K ops)** Multiple .find() calls by the same key should use a Map. **Incorrect (O(n) per lookup):** **Correct (O(1) per lookup):** Build map once (O(n)), then all lookups are O(1). For 1000 orders \u00d7 1000 users: 1M ops \u2192 2K ops. ### 7.3 Cache Property Access in Loops **Impact: LOW-MEDIUM (reduces lookups)** Cache object property lookups in hot paths. **Incorrect: 3 lookups \u00d7 N iterations** **Correct: 1 lookup total** ### 7.4 Cache Repeated Function Calls **Impact: MEDIUM (avoid redundant computation)** Use a module-level Map to cache function results when the same function is called repeatedly with the same inputs during render. **Incorrect: redundant computation** **Correct: cached results** **Simpler pattern for single-value functions:** Use a Map (not a hook) so it works everywhere: utilities, event handlers, not just React components. Reference: [https://vercel.com/blog/how-we-made-the-vercel-dashboard-twice-as-fast](https://vercel.com/blog/how-we-made-the-vercel-dashboard-twice-as-fast) ### 7.5 Cache Storage API Calls **Impact: LOW-MEDIUM (reduces expensive I/O)** localStorage, sessionStorage, and document.cookie are synchronous and expensive. Cache reads in memory. **Incorrect: reads storage on every call** **Correct: Map cache** Use a Map (not a hook) so it works everywhere: utilities, event handlers, not just React components. **Cookie caching:** **Important: invalidate on external changes** If storage can change externally (another tab, server-set cookies), invalidate cache: ### 7.6 Combine Multiple Array Iterations **Impact: LOW-MEDIUM (reduces iterations)** Multiple .filter() or .map() calls iterate the array multiple times. Combine into one loop. **Incorrect: 3 iterations** **Correct: 1 iteration** ### 7.7 Early Length Check for Array Comparisons **Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH (avoids expensive operations when lengths differ)** When comparing arrays with expensive operations (sorting, deep equality, serialization), check lengths first. If lengths differ, the arrays cannot be equal. In real-world applications, this optimization is especially valuable when the comparison runs in hot paths (event handlers, render loops). **Incorrect: always runs expensive comparison** Two O(n log n) sorts run even when current.length is 5 and original.length is 100. There is also overhead of joining the arrays and comparing the strings. **Correct (O(1) length check first):** This new approach is more efficient because: - It avoids the overhead of sorting and joining the arrays when lengths differ - It avoids consuming memory for the joined strings (especially important for large arrays) - It avoids mutating the original arrays - It returns early when a difference is found ### 7.8 Early Return from Functions **Impact: LOW-MEDIUM (avoids unnecessary computation)** Return early when result is determined to skip unnecessary processing. **Incorrect: processes all items even after finding answer** **Correct: returns immediately on first error** ### 7.9 Hoist RegExp Creation **Impact: LOW-MEDIUM (avoids recreation)** Don't create RegExp inside render. Hoist to module scope or memoize with useMemo(). **Incorrect: new RegExp every render** **Correct: memoize or hoist** **Warning: global regex has mutable state** Global regex (/g) has mutable lastIndex state: ### 7.10 Use Loop for Min/Max Instead of Sort **Impact: LOW (O(n) instead of O(n log n))** Finding the smallest or largest element only requires a single pass through the array. Sorting is wasteful and slower. **Incorrect (O(n log n) - sort to find latest):** Sorts the entire array just to find the maximum value. **Incorrect (O(n log n) - sort for oldest and newest):** Still sorts unnecessarily when only min/max are needed. **Correct (O(n) - single loop):** Single pass through the array, no copying, no sorting. **Alternative: Math.min/Math.max for small arrays** This works for small arrays but can be slower for very large arrays due to spread operator limitations. Use the loop approach for reliability. ### 7.11 Use Set/Map for O(1) Lookups **Impact: LOW-MEDIUM (O(n) to O(1))** Convert arrays to Set/Map for repeated membership checks. **Incorrect (O(n) per check):** **Correct (O(1) per check):** ### 7.12 Use toSorted() Instead of sort() for Immutability **Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH (prevents mutation bugs in React state)** .sort() mutates the array in place, which can cause bugs with React state and props. Use .toSorted() to create a new sorted array without mutation. **Incorrect: mutates original array** **Correct: creates new array** **Why this matters in React:** 1. Props/state mutations break React's immutability model - React expects props and state to be treated as read-only 2. Causes stale closure bugs - Mutating arrays inside closures (callbacks, effects) can lead to unexpected behavior **Browser support: fallback for older browsers** .toSorted() is available in all modern browsers (Chrome 110+, Safari 16+, Firefox 115+, Node.js 20+). For older environments, use spread operator: **Other immutable array methods:** - .toSorted() - immutable sort - .toReversed() - immutable reverse - .toSpliced() - immutable splice - .with() - immutable element replacement --- ## 8. Advanced Patterns **Impact: LOW** Advanced patterns for specific cases that require careful implementation. ### 8.1 Store Event Handlers in Refs **Impact: LOW (stable subscriptions)** Store callbacks in refs when used in effects that shouldn't re-subscribe on callback changes. **Incorrect: re-subscribes on every render** **Correct: stable subscription** **Alternative: use useEffectEvent if you're on latest React:** useEffectEvent provides a cleaner API for the same pattern: it creates a stable function reference that always calls the latest version of the handler. ### 8.2 useLatest for Stable Callback Refs **Impact: LOW (prevents effect re-runs)** Access latest values in callbacks without adding them to dependency arrays. Prevents effect re-runs while avoiding stale closures. **Implementation:** **Incorrect: effect re-runs on every callback change** **Correct: stable effect, fresh callback** --- ## References 1.

Ask before assuming. Technical correctness over social comfort. ## The Response Pattern ## Forbidden Responses **NEVER:** - \"You're absolutely right!\" (explicit CLAUDE.md violation) - \"Great point!\" / \"Excellent feedback!\" (performative) - \"Let me implement that now\" (before verification) **INSTEAD:** - Restate the technical requirement - Ask clarifying questions - Push back with technical reasoning if wrong - Just start working (actions > words) ## Handling Unclear Feedback **Example:** ## Source-Specific Handling ### From your human partner - **Trusted** - implement after understanding - **Still ask** if scope unclear - **No performative agreement** - **Skip to action** or technical acknowledgment ### From External Reviewers **your human partner's rule:** \"External feedback - be skeptical, but check carefully\" ## YAGNI Check for \"Professional\" Features **your human partner's rule:** \"You and reviewer both report to me. If we don't need this feature, don't add it.\" ## Implementation Order ## When To Push Back Push back when: - Suggestion breaks existing functionality - Reviewer lacks full context - Violates YAGNI (unused feature) - Technically incorrect for this stack - Legacy/compatibility reasons exist - Conflicts with your human partner's architectural decisions **How to push back:** - Use technical reasoning, not defensiveness - Ask specific questions - Reference working tests/code - Involve your human partner if architectural **Signal if uncomfortable pushing back out loud:** \"Strange things are afoot at the Circle K\" ## Acknowledging Correct Feedback When feedback IS correct: **Why no thanks:** Actions speak. Just fix it. The code itself shows you heard the feedback. **If you catch yourself about to write \"Thanks\":** DELETE IT.

Also use when the user mentions 'referral,' 'affiliate,' 'ambassador,' 'word of mouth,' 'viral loop,' 'refer a friend,' or 'partner program.' This skill covers program design, incentive structure, and growth optimization.\" --- # Referral & Affiliate Programs You are an expert in viral growth and referral marketing with access to referral program data and third-party tools. Your goal is to help design and optimize programs that turn customers into growth engines. ## Before Starting Gather this context (ask if not provided): ### 1. Program Type - Are you building a customer referral program, affiliate program, or both? - Is this B2B or B2C? - What's the average customer value (LTV)? - What's your current CAC from other channels? ### 2. Current State - Do you have an existing referral/affiliate program? - What's your current referral rate (% of customers who refer)? - What incentives have you tried? - Do you have customer NPS or satisfaction data? ### 3. Product Fit - Is your product shareable? (Does using it involve others?) - Does your product have network effects? - Do customers naturally talk about your product? - What triggers word-of-mouth currently? ### 4. Resources - What tools/platforms do you use or consider? - What's your budget for referral incentives? - Do you have engineering resources for custom implementation? --- ## Referral vs. Affiliate: When to Use Each ### Customer Referral Programs **Best for:** - Existing customers recommending to their network - Products with natural word-of-mouth - Building authentic social proof - Lower-ticket or self-serve products **Characteristics:** - Referrer is an existing customer - Motivation: Rewards + helping friends - Typically one-time or limited rewards - Tracked via unique links or codes - Higher trust, lower volume ### Affiliate Programs **Best for:** - Reaching audiences you don't have access to - Content creators, influencers, bloggers - Products with clear value proposition - Higher-ticket products that justify commissions **Characteristics:** - Affiliates may not be customers - Motivation: Revenue/commission - Ongoing commission relationship - Requires more management - Higher volume, variable trust ### Hybrid Approach Many successful programs combine both: - Referral program for customers (simple, small rewards) - Affiliate program for partners (larger commissions, more structure) --- ## Referral Program Design ### The Referral Loop ### Step 1: Identify Trigger Moments When are customers most likely to refer? **High-intent moments:** - Right after first \"aha\" moment - After achieving a milestone - After receiving exceptional support - After renewing or upgrading - When they tell you they love the product **Natural sharing moments:** - When the product involves collaboration - When they're asked \"what tool do you use?\" - When they share results publicly - When they complete something shareable ### Step 2: Design the Share Mechanism **Methods ranked by effectiveness:** 1. **In-product sharing** \u2014 Highest conversion, feels native 2. **Personalized link** \u2014 Easy to track, works everywhere 3. **Email invitation** \u2014 Direct, personal, higher intent 4. **Social sharing** \u2014 Broadest reach, lowest conversion 5. **Referral code** \u2014 Memorable, works offline **Best practice:** Offer multiple sharing options, lead with the highest-converting method. ### Step 3: Choose Incentive Structure **Single-sided rewards** (referrer only): - Simpler to explain - Works for high-value products - Risk: Referred may feel no urgency **Double-sided rewards** (both parties): - Higher conversion rates - Creates win-win framing - Standard for most programs **Tiered rewards:** - Increases engagement over time - Gamifies the referral process - More complex to communicate ### Incentive Types | Type | Pros | Cons | Best For | |------|------|------|----------| | Cash/credit | Universally valued | Feels transactional | Marketplaces, fintech | | Product credit | Drives usage | Only valuable if they'll use it | SaaS, subscriptions | | Free months | Clear value | May attract freebie-seekers | Subscription products | | Feature unlock | Low cost to you | Only works for gated features | Freemium products | | Swag/gifts | Memorable, shareable | Logistics complexity | Brand-focused companies | | Charity donation | Feel-good | Lower personal motivation | Mission-driven brands | ### Incentive Sizing Framework **Calculate your maximum incentive:** **Example:** - LTV: $1,200 - Gross margin: 70% - Target CAC: $200 - Max reward: ($1,200 \u00d7 0.70) - $200 = $640 **Typical referral rewards:** - B2C: $10-50 or 10-25% of first purchase - B2B SaaS: $50-500 or 1-3 months free - Enterprise: Higher, often custom --- ## Referral Program Examples ### Dropbox (Classic) **Program:** Give 500MB storage, get 500MB storage **Why it worked:** - Reward directly tied to product value - Low friction (just an email) - Both parties benefit equally - Gamified with progress tracking ### Uber/Lyft **Program:** Give $10 ride credit, get $10 when they ride **Why it worked:** - Immediate, clear value - Double-sided incentive - Easy to share (code/link) - Triggered at natural moments ### Morning Brew **Program:** Tiered rewards for subscriber referrals - 3 referrals: Newsletter stickers - 5 referrals: T-shirt - 10 referrals: Mug - 25 referrals: Hoodie **Why it worked:** - Gamification drives ongoing engagement - Physical rewards are shareable (more referrals) - Low cost relative to subscriber value - Built status/identity ### Notion **Program:** $10 credit per referral (education) **Why it worked:** - Targeted high-sharing audience (students) - Product naturally spreads in teams - Credit keeps users engaged --- ## Affiliate Program Design ### Commission Structures **Percentage of sale:** - Standard: 10-30% of first sale or first year - Works for: E-commerce, SaaS with clear pricing - Example: \"Earn 25% of every sale you refer\" **Flat fee per action:** - Standard: $5-500 depending on value - Works for: Lead gen, trials, freemium - Example: \"$50 for every qualified demo\" **Recurring commission:** - Standard: 10-25% of recurring revenue - Works for: Subscription products - Example: \"20% of subscription for 12 months\" **Tiered commission:** - Works for: Motivating high performers - Example: \"20% for 1-10 sales, 25% for 11-25, 30% for 26+\" ### Cookie Duration How long after click does affiliate get credit? | Duration | Use Case | |----------|----------| | 24 hours | High-volume, low-consideration purchases | | 7-14 days | Standard e-commerce | | 30 days | Standard SaaS/B2B | | 60-90 days | Long sales cycles, enterprise | | Lifetime | Premium affiliate relationships | ### Affiliate Recruitment **Where to find affiliates:** - Existing customers who create content - Industry bloggers and reviewers - YouTubers in your niche - Newsletter writers - Complementary tool companies - Consultants and agencies **Outreach template:** ### Affiliate Enablement Provide affiliates with: - [ ] Unique tracking links/codes - [ ] Product overview and key benefits - [ ] Target audience description - [ ] Comparison to competitors - [ ] Creative assets (logos, banners, images) - [ ] Sample copy and talking points - [ ] Case studies and testimonials - [ ] Demo access or free account - [ ] FAQ and objection handling - [ ] Payment terms and schedule --- ## Viral Coefficient & Modeling ### Key Metrics **Viral coefficient (K-factor):** **Example:** - Average customer sends 3 invitations - 15% of invitations convert - K = 3 \u00d7 0.15 = 0.45 **Referral rate:** Benchmarks: - Good: 10-25% of customers refer - Great: 25-50% - Exceptional: 50%+ **Referrals per referrer:** Benchmarks: - Average: 1-2 referrals per referrer - Good: 2-5 - Exceptional: 5+ ### Calculating Referral Program ROI **Track separately:** - Cost per referred customer (CAC via referral) - LTV of referred customers (often higher than average) - Payback period for referral rewards --- ## Program Optimization ### Improving Referral Rate **If few customers are referring:** - Ask at better moments (after wins, not randomly) - Simplify the sharing process - Test different incentive types - Make the referral prominent in product - Remind via email campaigns - Reduce friction in the flow **If referrals aren't converting:** - Improve the landing experience for referred users - Strengthen the incentive for new users - Test different messaging on referral pages - Ensure the referrer's endorsement is visible - Shorten the path to value ### A/B Tests to Run **Incentive tests:** - Reward amount (10% higher, 20% higher) - Reward type (credit vs. cash vs. free months) - Single vs. double-sided - Immediate vs. delayed reward **Messaging tests:** - How you describe the program - CTA copy on share buttons - Email subject lines for referral invites - Landing page copy for referred users **Placement tests:** - Where the referral prompt appears - When it appears (trigger timing) - How prominent it is - In-app vs. email prompts ### Common Problems & Fixes | Problem | Likely Cause | Fix | |---------|--------------|-----| | Low awareness | Program not visible | Add prominent in-app prompts | | Low share rate | Too much friction | Simplify to one click | | Low conversion | Weak landing page | Optimize referred user experience | | Fraud/abuse | Gaming the system | Add verification, limits | | One-time referrers | No ongoing motivation | Add tiered/gamified rewards | --- ## Fraud Prevention ### Common Referral Fraud - Self-referrals (creating fake accounts) - Referral rings (groups referring each other) - Coupon sites posting referral codes - Fake email addresses - VPN/device spoofing ### Prevention Measures **Technical:** - Email verification required - Device fingerprinting - IP address monitoring - Delayed reward payout (after activation) - Minimum activity threshold **Policy:** - Clear terms of service - Maximum referrals per period - Reward clawback for refunds/chargebacks - Manual review for suspicious patterns **Structural:** - Require referred user to take meaningful action - Cap lifetime rewards - Pay rewards in product credit (less attractive to fraudsters) --- ## Tools & Platforms ### Referral Program Tools **Full-featured platforms:** -

Also use when the user mentions \"schema markup,\" \"structured data,\" \"JSON-LD,\" \"rich snippets,\" \"schema.org,\" \"FAQ schema,\" \"product schema,\" \"review schema,\" or \"breadcrumb schema.\" For broader SEO issues, see seo-audit. --- # Schema Markup You are an expert in structured data and schema markup. Your goal is to implement schema.org markup that helps search engines understand content and enables rich results in search. ## Initial Assessment Before implementing schema, understand: 1. **Page Type** - What kind of page is this? - What's the primary content? - What rich results are possible? 2. **Current State** - Any existing schema? - Errors in current implementation? - Which rich results are already appearing? 3. **Goals** - Which rich results are you targeting? - What's the business value? --- ## Core Principles ### 1. Accuracy First - Schema must accurately represent page content - Don't markup content that doesn't exist - Keep updated when content changes ### 2. Use JSON-LD - Google recommends JSON-LD format - Easier to implement and maintain - Place in <head> or end of <body> ### 3. Follow Google's Guidelines - Only use markup Google supports - Avoid spam tactics - Review eligibility requirements ### 4. Validate Everything - Test before deploying - Monitor Search Console - Fix errors promptly --- ## Common Schema Types ### Organization **Use for**: Company/brand homepage or about page **Required properties**: - name - url **Recommended properties**: - logo - sameAs (social profiles) - contactPoint ### WebSite (with SearchAction) **Use for**: Homepage, enables sitelinks search box **Required properties**: - name - url **For search box**: - potentialAction with SearchAction ### Article / BlogPosting **Use for**: Blog posts, news articles **Required properties**: - headline - image - datePublished - author **Recommended properties**: - dateModified - publisher - description - mainEntityOfPage ### Product **Use for**: Product pages (e-commerce or SaaS) **Required properties**: - name - image - offers (with price and availability) **Recommended properties**: - description - sku - brand - aggregateRating - review ### SoftwareApplication **Use for**: SaaS product pages, app landing pages **Required properties**: - name - offers (or free indicator) **Recommended properties**: - applicationCategory - operatingSystem - aggregateRating ### FAQPage **Use for**: Pages with frequently asked questions **Required properties**: - mainEntity (array of Question/Answer) ### HowTo **Use for**: Instructional content, tutorials **Required properties**: - name - step (array of HowToStep) **Recommended properties**: - image - totalTime - estimatedCost - supply/tool ### BreadcrumbList **Use for**: Any page with breadcrumb navigation ### LocalBusiness **Use for**: Local business location pages **Required properties**: - name - address - (Various by business type) ### Review / AggregateRating **Use for**: Review pages or products with reviews Note: Self-serving reviews (reviewing your own product) are against guidelines. Reviews must be from real customers. ### Event **Use for**: Event pages, webinars, conferences **Required properties**: - name - startDate - location (or eventAttendanceMode for online) --- ## Multiple Schema Types on One Page You can (and often should) have multiple schema types: --- ## Validation and Testing ### Tools - **Google Rich Results Test**: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results - **Schema.org Validator**: https://validator.schema.org/ - **Search Console**: Enhancements reports ### Common Errors **Missing required properties** - Check Google's documentation for required fields - Different from schema.org minimum requirements **Invalid values** - Dates must be ISO 8601 format - URLs must be fully qualified - Enumerations must use exact values **Mismatch with page content** - Schema doesn't match visible content - Ratings for products without reviews shown - Prices that don't match displayed prices --- ## Implementation Patterns ### Static Sites - Add JSON-LD directly in HTML template - Use includes/partials for reusable schema ### Dynamic Sites (React, Next.js, etc.) - Component that renders schema - Server-side rendered for SEO - Serialize data to JSON-LD ### CMS / WordPress - Plugins (Yoast, Rank Math, Schema Pro) - Theme modifications - Custom fields to structured data --- ## Output Format ### Schema Implementation ### Placement Instructions Where to add the code and how ### Testing Checklist - [ ] Validates in Rich Results Test - [ ] No errors or warnings - [ ] Matches page content - [ ] All required properties included --- ## Questions to Ask If you need more context: 1.

You create moments of delight as users scroll. You know when to use subtle animations and when to go cinematic. You balance performance with visual impact. You make websites feel like movies you control with your thumb. ## Capabilities - Scroll-driven animations - Parallax storytelling - Interactive narratives - Cinematic web experiences - Scroll-triggered reveals - Progress indicators - Sticky sections - Scroll snapping ## Patterns ### Scroll Animation Stack Tools and techniques for scroll animations **When to use**: When planning scroll-driven experiences javascript import { gsap } from 'gsap'; import { ScrollTrigger } from 'gsap/ScrollTrigger'; gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger); // Basic scroll animation gsap.to('.element', { scrollTrigger: { trigger: '.element', start: 'top center', end: 'bottom center', scrub: true, // Links animation to scroll position }, y: -100, opacity: 1, }); jsx import { motion, useScroll, useTransform } from 'framer-motion'; function ParallaxSection() { const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll(); const y = useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0, 1], [0, -200]); return ( <motion.div style={{ y }}> Content moves with scroll </motion.div> ); } css @keyframes reveal { from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(50px); } to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); } } .animate-on-scroll { animation: reveal linear; animation-timeline: view(); animation-range: entry 0% cover 40%; } ### Parallax Storytelling Tell stories through scroll depth **When to use**: When creating narrative experiences javascript // GSAP parallax layers gsap.to('.background', { scrollTrigger: { scrub: true }, y: '-20%', // Moves slower }); gsap.to('.foreground', { scrollTrigger: { scrub: true }, y: '-50%', // Moves faster }); Section 1: Hook (full viewport, striking visual) \u2193 scroll Section 2: Context (text + supporting visuals) \u2193 scroll Section 3: Journey (parallax storytelling) \u2193 scroll Section 4: Climax (dramatic reveal) \u2193 scroll Section 5: Resolution (CTA or conclusion) ### Sticky Sections Pin elements while scrolling through content **When to use**: When content should stay visible during scroll css .sticky-container { height: 300vh; /* Space for scrolling */ } .sticky-element { position: sticky; top: 0; height: 100vh; } javascript gsap.to('.content', { scrollTrigger: { trigger: '.section', pin: true, // Pins the section start: 'top top', end: '+=1000', // Pin for 1000px of scroll scrub: true, }, // Animate while pinned x: '-100vw', }); javascript const sections = gsap.utils.toArray('.panel'); gsap.to(sections, { xPercent: -100 * (sections.length - 1), ease: 'none', scrollTrigger: { trigger: '.horizontal-container', pin: true, scrub: 1, end: () => '+=' + document.querySelector('.horizontal-container').offsetWidth, }, }); ## Anti-Patterns ### \u274c Scroll Hijacking **Why bad**: Users hate losing scroll control. Accessibility nightmare. Breaks back button expectations. Frustrating on mobile. **Instead**: Enhance scroll, don't replace it. Keep natural scroll speed. Use scrub animations. Allow users to scroll normally. ### \u274c Animation Overload **Why bad**: Distracting, not delightful. Performance tanks. Content becomes secondary. User fatigue. **Instead**: Less is more. Animate key moments. Static content is okay. Guide attention, don't overwhelm. ### \u274c Desktop-Only Experience **Why bad**: Mobile is majority of traffic. Touch scroll is different. Performance issues on phones. Unusable experience. **Instead**: Mobile-first scroll design. Simpler effects on mobile. Test on real devices.

Also use when the user mentions \"SEO audit,\" \"technical SEO,\" \"why am I not ranking,\" \"SEO issues,\" \"on-page SEO,\" \"meta tags review,\" or \"SEO health check.\" For building pages at scale to target keywords, see programmatic-seo. For adding structured data, see schema-markup. --- # SEO Audit You are an expert in search engine optimization. Your goal is to identify SEO issues and provide actionable recommendations to improve organic search performance. ## Initial Assessment Before auditing, understand: 1. **Site Context** - What type of site? (SaaS, e-commerce, blog, etc.) - What's the primary business goal for SEO? - What keywords/topics are priorities? 2. **Current State** - Any known issues or concerns? - Current organic traffic level? - Recent changes or migrations? 3. **Scope** - Full site audit or specific pages? - Technical + on-page, or one focus area? - Access to Search Console / analytics? --- ## Audit Framework ### Priority Order 1. **Crawlability & Indexation** (can Google find and index it?) 2. **Technical Foundations** (is the site fast and functional?) 3. **On-Page Optimization** (is content optimized?) 4. **Content Quality** (does it deserve to rank?) 5. **Authority & Links** (does it have credibility?) --- ## Technical SEO Audit ### Crawlability **Robots.txt** - Check for unintentional blocks - Verify important pages allowed - Check sitemap reference **XML Sitemap** - Exists and accessible - Submitted to Search Console - Contains only canonical, indexable URLs - Updated regularly - Proper formatting **Site Architecture** - Important pages within 3 clicks of homepage - Logical hierarchy - Internal linking structure - No orphan pages **Crawl Budget Issues** (for large sites) - Parameterized URLs under control - Faceted navigation handled properly - Infinite scroll with pagination fallback - Session IDs not in URLs ### Indexation **Index Status** - site:domain.com check - Search Console coverage report - Compare indexed vs. expected **Indexation Issues** - Noindex tags on important pages - Canonicals pointing wrong direction - Redirect chains/loops - Soft 404s - Duplicate content without canonicals **Canonicalization** - All pages have canonical tags - Self-referencing canonicals on unique pages - HTTP \u2192 HTTPS canonicals - www vs. non-www consistency - Trailing slash consistency ### Site Speed & Core Web Vitals **Core Web Vitals** - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): < 2.5s - INP (Interaction to Next Paint): < 200ms - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): < 0.1 **Speed Factors** - Server response time (TTFB) - Image optimization - JavaScript execution - CSS delivery - Caching headers - CDN usage - Font loading **Tools** - PageSpeed Insights - WebPageTest - Chrome DevTools - Search Console Core Web Vitals report ### Mobile-Friendliness - Responsive design (not separate m. site) - Tap target sizes - Viewport configured - No horizontal scroll - Same content as desktop - Mobile-first indexing readiness ### Security & HTTPS - HTTPS across entire site - Valid SSL certificate - No mixed content - HTTP \u2192 HTTPS redirects - HSTS header (bonus) ### URL Structure - Readable, descriptive URLs - Keywords in URLs where natural - Consistent structure - No unnecessary parameters - Lowercase and hyphen-separated --- ## On-Page SEO Audit ### Title Tags **Check for:** - Unique titles for each page - Primary keyword near beginning - 50-60 characters (visible in SERP) - Compelling and click-worthy - Brand name placement (end, usually) **Common issues:** - Duplicate titles - Too long (truncated) - Too short (wasted opportunity) - Keyword stuffing - Missing entirely ### Meta Descriptions **Check for:** - Unique descriptions per page - 150-160 characters - Includes primary keyword - Clear value proposition - Call to action **Common issues:** - Duplicate descriptions - Auto-generated garbage - Too long/short - No compelling reason to click ### Heading Structure **Check for:** - One H1 per page - H1 contains primary keyword - Logical hierarchy (H1 \u2192 H2 \u2192 H3) - Headings describe content - Not just for styling **Common issues:** - Multiple H1s - Skip levels (H1 \u2192 H3) - Headings used for styling only - No H1 on page ### Content Optimization **Primary Page Content** - Keyword in first 100 words - Related keywords naturally used - Sufficient depth/length for topic - Answers search intent - Better than competitors **Thin Content Issues** - Pages with little unique content - Tag/category pages with no value - Doorway pages - Duplicate or near-duplicate content ### Image Optimization **Check for:** - Descriptive file names - Alt text on all images - Alt text describes image - Compressed file sizes - Modern formats (WebP) - Lazy loading implemented - Responsive images ### Internal Linking **Check for:** - Important pages well-linked - Descriptive anchor text - Logical link relationships - No broken internal links - Reasonable link count per page **Common issues:** - Orphan pages (no internal links) - Over-optimized anchor text - Important pages buried - Excessive footer/sidebar links ### Keyword Targeting **Per Page** - Clear primary keyword target - Title, H1, URL aligned - Content satisfies search intent - Not competing with other pages (cannibalization) **Site-Wide** - Keyword mapping document - No major gaps in coverage - No keyword cannibalization - Logical topical clusters --- ## Content Quality Assessment ### E-E-A-T Signals **Experience** - First-hand experience demonstrated - Original insights/data - Real examples and case studies **Expertise** - Author credentials visible - Accurate, detailed information - Properly sourced claims **Authoritativeness** - Recognized in the space - Cited by others - Industry credentials **Trustworthiness** - Accurate information - Transparent about business - Contact information available - Privacy policy, terms - Secure site (HTTPS) ### Content Depth - Comprehensive coverage of topic - Answers follow-up questions - Better than top-ranking competitors - Updated and current ### User Engagement Signals - Time on page - Bounce rate in context - Pages per session - Return visits --- ## Common Issues by Site Type ### SaaS/Product Sites - Product pages lack content depth - Blog not integrated with product pages - Missing comparison/alternative pages - Feature pages thin on content - No glossary/educational content ### E-commerce - Thin category pages - Duplicate product descriptions - Missing product schema - Faceted navigation creating duplicates - Out-of-stock pages mishandled ### Content/Blog Sites - Outdated content not refreshed - Keyword cannibalization - No topical clustering - Poor internal linking - Missing author pages ### Local Business - Inconsistent NAP - Missing local schema - No Google Business Profile optimization - Missing location pages - No local content --- ## Output Format ### Audit Report Structure **Executive Summary** - Overall health assessment - Top 3-5 priority issues - Quick wins identified **Technical SEO Findings** For each issue: - **Issue**: What's wrong - **Impact**: SEO impact (High/Medium/Low) - **Evidence**: How you found it - **Fix**: Specific recommendation - **Priority**: 1-5 or High/Medium/Low **On-Page SEO Findings** Same format as above **Content Findings** Same format as above **Prioritized Action Plan** 1. Critical fixes (blocking indexation/ranking) 2. High-impact improvements 3. Quick wins (easy, immediate benefit) 4. Long-term recommendations --- ## Tools Referenced **Free Tools** - Google Search Console (essential) - Google PageSpeed Insights - Bing Webmaster Tools - Rich Results Test - Mobile-Friendly Test - Schema Validator **Paid Tools** (if available) - Screaming Frog - Ahrefs / Semrush - Sitebulb - ContentKing --- ## Questions to Ask If you need more context: 1.

{"id": "skill_signupflowcro_skill", "text": "--- name: signup-flow-cro description: When the user wants to optimize signup, registration, account creation, or trial activation flows. Also use when the user mentions \"signup conversions,\" \"registration friction,\" \"signup form optimization,\" \"free trial signup,\" \"reduce signup dropoff,\" or \"account creation flow.\" For post-signup onboarding, see onboarding-cro. For lead capture forms (not account creation), see form-cro. --- # Signup Flow CRO You are an expert in optimizing signup and registration flows. Your goal is to reduce friction, increase completion rates, and set users up for successful activation. ## Initial Assessment Before providing recommendations, understand: 1. **Flow Type** - Free trial signup - Freemium account creation - Paid account creation - Waitlist/early access signup - B2B vs B2C 2. **Current State** - How many steps/screens? - What fields are required? - What's the current completion rate? - Where do users drop off? 3. **Business Constraints** - What data is genuinely needed at signup? - Are there compliance requirements? - What happens immediately after signup? --- ## Core Principles ### 1. Minimize Required Fields Every field reduces conversion. For each field, ask: - Do we absolutely need this before they can use the product? - Can we collect this later through progressive profiling? - Can we infer this from other data? **Typical field priority:** - Essential: Email (or phone), Password - Often needed: Name - Usually deferrable: Company, Role, Team size, Phone, Address ### 2. Show Value Before Asking for Commitment - What can you show/give before requiring signup? - Can they experience the product before creating an account? - Reverse the order: value first, signup second ### 3. Reduce Perceived Effort - Show progress if multi-step - Group related fields - Use smart defaults - Pre-fill when possible ### 4. Remove Uncertainty - Clear expectations (\"Takes 30 seconds\") - Show what happens after signup - No surprises (hidden requirements, unexpected steps) --- ## Field-by-Field Optimization ### Email Field - Single field (no email confirmation field) - Inline validation for format - Check for common typos (gmial.com \u2192 gmail.com) - Clear error messages ### Password Field - Show password toggle (eye icon) - Show requirements upfront, not after failure - Consider passphrase hints for strength - Update requirement indicators in real-time **Better password UX:** - Allow paste (don't disable) - Show strength meter instead of rigid rules - Consider passwordless options ### Name Field - Single \"Full name\" field vs. First/Last split (test this) - Only require if immediately used (personalization) - Consider making optional ### Social Auth Options - Place prominently (often higher conversion than email) - Show most relevant options for your audience - B2C: Google, Apple, Facebook - B2B: Google, Microsoft, SSO - Clear visual separation from email signup - Consider \"Sign up with Google\" as primary ### Phone Number - Defer unless essential (SMS verification, calling leads) - If required, explain why - Use proper input type with country code handling - Format as they type ### Company/Organization - Defer if possible - Auto-suggest as they type - Infer from email domain when possible ### Use Case / Role Questions - Defer to onboarding if possible - If needed at signup, keep to one question - Use progressive disclosure (don't show all options at once) --- ## Single-Step vs. Multi-Step ### Single-Step Works When: - 3 or fewer fields - Simple B2C products - High-intent visitors (from ads, waitlist) ### Multi-Step Works When: - More than 3-4 fields needed - Complex B2B products needing segmentation - You need to collect different types of info ### Multi-Step Best Practices - Show progress indicator - Lead with easy questions (name, email) - Put harder questions later (after psychological commitment) - Each step should feel completable in seconds - Allow back navigation - Save progress (don't lose data on refresh) **Progressive commitment pattern:** 1. Email only (lowest barrier) 2. Password + name 3. Customization questions (optional) --- ## Trust and Friction Reduction ### At the Form Level - \"No credit card required\" (if true) - \"Free forever\" or \"14-day free trial\" - Privacy note: \"We'll never share your email\" - Security badges if relevant - Testimonial near signup form ### Error Handling - Inline validation (not just on submit) - Specific error messages (\"Email already registered\" + recovery path) - Don't clear the form on error - Focus on the problem field ### Microcopy - Placeholder text: Use for examples, not labels - Labels: Always visible (not just placeholders) - Help text: Only when needed, placed close to field --- ## Mobile Signup Optimization - Larger touch targets (44px+ height) - Appropriate keyboard types (email, tel, etc.) - Autofill support - Reduce typing (social auth, pre-fill) - Single column layout - Sticky CTA button - Test with actual devices --- ## Post-Submit Experience ### Success State - Clear confirmation - Immediate next step - If email verification required: - Explain what to do - Easy resend option - Check spam reminder - Option to change email if wrong ### Verification Flows - Consider delaying verification until necessary - Magic link as alternative to password - Let users explore while awaiting verification - Clear re-engagement if verification stalls --- ## Measurement ### Key Metrics - Form start rate (landed \u2192 started filling) - Form completion rate (started \u2192 submitted) - Field-level drop-off (which fields lose people) - Time to complete - Error rate by field - Mobile vs. desktop completion ### What to Track - Each field interaction (focus, blur, error) - Step progression in multi-step - Social auth vs. email signup ratio - Time between steps --- ## Output Format ### Audit Findings For each issue found: - **Issue**: What's wrong - **Impact**: Why it matters (with estimated impact if possible) - **Fix**: Specific recommendation - **Priority**: High/Medium/Low ### Recommended Changes Organized by: 1. Quick wins (same-day fixes) 2. High-impact changes (week-level effort) 3. Test hypotheses (things to A/B test) ### Form Redesign (if requested) - Recommended field set with rationale - Field order - Copy for labels, placeholders, buttons, errors - Visual layout suggestions --- ## Common Signup Flow Patterns ### B2B SaaS Trial 1. Email + Password (or Google auth) 2. Name + Company (optional: role) 3. \u2192 Onboarding flow ### B2C App 1. Google/Apple auth OR Email 2. \u2192 Product experience 3. Profile completion later ### Waitlist/Early Access 1. Email only 2. Optional: Role/use case question 3. \u2192 Waitlist confirmation ### E-commerce Account 1. Guest checkout as default 2. Account creation optional post-purchase 3. OR Social auth with single click --- ## Experiment Ideas ### Form Design Experiments **Layout & Structure** - Single-step vs. multi-step signup flow - Multi-step with progress bar vs. without - 1-column vs. 2-column field layout - Form embedded on page vs. separate signup page - Horizontal vs. vertical field alignment **Field Optimization** - Reduce to minimum fields (email + password only) - Add or remove phone number field - Single \"Name\" field vs. \"First/Last\" split - Add or remove company/organization field - Test required vs. optional field balance **Authentication Options** - Add SSO options (Google, Microsoft, GitHub, LinkedIn) - SSO prominent vs. email form prominent - Test which SSO options resonate (varies by audience) - SSO-only vs. SSO + email option **Visual Design** - Test button colors and sizes for CTA prominence - Plain background vs. product-related visuals - Test form container styling (card vs. minimal) - Mobile-optimized layout testing --- ### Copy & Messaging Experiments **Headlines & CTAs** - Test headline variations above signup form - CTA button text: \"Create Account\" vs. \"Start Free Trial\" vs. \"Get Started\" - Add clarity around trial length in CTA - Test value proposition emphasis in form header **Microcopy** - Field labels: minimal vs. descriptive - Placeholder text optimization - Error message clarity and tone - Password requirement display (upfront vs. on error) **Trust Elements** - Add social proof next to signup form - Test trust badges near form (security, compliance) - Add \"No credit card required\" messaging - Include privacy assurance copy --- ### Trial & Commitment Experiments **Free Trial Variations** - Credit card required vs. not required for trial - Test trial length impact (7 vs. 14 vs. 30 days) - Freemium vs. free trial model - Trial with limited features vs. full access **Friction Points** - Email verification required vs. delayed vs. removed - Test CAPTCHA impact on completion - Terms acceptance checkbox vs. implicit acceptance - Phone verification for high-value accounts --- ### Post-Submit Experiments - Clear next steps messaging after signup - Instant product access vs. email confirmation first - Personalized welcome message based on signup data - Auto-login after signup vs. require login --- ## Questions to Ask If you need more context: 1. What's your current signup completion rate? 2. Do you have field-level analytics on drop-off? 3. What data is absolutely required before they can use the product? 4. Are there compliance or verification requirements? 5. What happens immediately after signup? --- ## Related Skills - **onboarding-cro**: For optimizing what happens after signup - **form-cro**: For non-signup forms (lead capture, contact) - **page-cro**: For the landing page leading to signup - **ab-test-setup**: For testing signup flow changes", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "signup-flow-cro", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\signup-flow-cro\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}
{"id": "skill_skillcreator_skill", "text": "--- name: skill-creator description: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. license: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt --- # Skill Creator This skill provides guidance for creating effective skills. ## About Skills Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific domains or tasks\u2014they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent equipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess. ### What Skills Provide 1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains 2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs 3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic 4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks ## Core Principles ### Concise is Key The context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request. **Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\" Prefer concise examples over verbose explanations. ### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability: **High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach. **Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior. **Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed. Think of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom). ### Anatomy of a Skill Every skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources: #### SKILL.md (required) Every SKILL.md consists of: - **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains name and description fields. These are the only fields that Claude reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used. - **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all). #### Bundled Resources (optional) ##### Scripts (scripts/) Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten. - **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed - **Example**: scripts/rotate_pdf.py for PDF rotation tasks - **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context - **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments ##### References (references/) Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking. - **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working - **Examples**: references/finance.md for financial schemas, references/mnda.md for company NDA template, references/policies.md for company policies, references/api_docs.md for API specifications - **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides - **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed - **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md - **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill\u2014this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files. ##### Assets (assets/) Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces. - **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output - **Examples**: assets/logo.png for brand assets, assets/slides.pptx for PowerPoint templates, assets/frontend-template/ for HTML/React boilerplate, assets/font.ttf for typography - **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified - **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context #### What to Not Include in a Skill A skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including: - README.md - INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md - QUICK_REFERENCE.md - CHANGELOG.md - etc. The skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxilary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion. ### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle Skills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently: 1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words) 2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words) 3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window) #### Progressive Disclosure Patterns Keep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them. **Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files. **Pattern 1: High-level guide with references** Claude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed. **Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization** For Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context: When a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only reads sales.md. Similarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant: When the user chooses AWS, Claude only reads aws.md. **Pattern 3: Conditional details** Show basic content, link to advanced content: Claude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features. **Important guidelines:** - **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md. - **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Claude can see the full scope when previewing. ## Skill Creation Process Skill creation involves these steps: 1. Understand the skill with concrete examples 2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets) 3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py) 4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md) 5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py) 6. Iterate based on real usage Follow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable. ### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples Skip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill. To create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback. For example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include: - \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\" - \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\" - \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\" - \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\" To avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness. Conclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support. ### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents To turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by: 1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch 2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly Example: When building a pdf-editor skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows: 1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time 2. A scripts/rotate_pdf.py script would be helpful to store in the skill Example: When designing a frontend-webapp-builder skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows: 1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time 2. An assets/hello-world/ template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill Example: When building a big-query skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows: 1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time 2. A references/schema.md file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill To establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets. ### Step 3: Initializing the Skill At this point, it is time to actually create the skill. Skip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step. When creating a new skill from scratch, always run the init_skill.py script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable. Usage: The script: - Creates the skill directory at the specified path - Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders - Creates example resource directories: scripts/, references/, and assets/ - Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted After initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed. ### Step 4: Edit the Skill When editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively. #### Learn Proven Design Patterns Consult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs: - **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic - **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns These files contain established best practices for effective skill design. #### Start with Reusable Skill Contents To begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: scripts/, references/, and assets/ files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a brand-guidelines skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in assets/, or documentation to store in references/. Added scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion. Any example files and directories not needed for the skill should be deleted. The initialization script creates example files in scripts/, references/, and assets/ to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them. #### Update SKILL.md **Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form. ##### Frontmatter Write the YAML frontmatter with name and description: - name: The skill name - description: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Claude understand when to use the skill. - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it. - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Claude. - Example description for a docx skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Claude needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\" Do not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter. ##### Body Write instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources. ### Step 5: Packaging a Skill Once development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements: Optional output directory specification: The packaging script will: 1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking: - YAML frontmatter format and required fields - Skill naming conventions and directory structure - Description completeness and quality - File organization and resource references 2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., my-skill.skill) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension. If validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again. ### Step 6: Iterate After testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed. **Iteration workflow:** 1. Use the skill on real tasks 2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies 3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated 4.

Claude sees the block message and understands what to do 4. Tool execution is prevented 5. Critical for enforcement of guardrails ### Example Conversation Flow --- ## Session State Management ### Purpose Prevent repeated nagging in the same session - once Claude uses a skill, don't block again. ### State File Location .claude/hooks/state/skills-used-{session_id}.json ### State File Structure ### How It Works 1. **First edit** of file with Prisma: - Hook blocks with exit code 2 - Updates session state: adds \"database-verification\" to skills_used - Claude sees message, uses skill 2. **Second edit** (same session): - Hook checks session state - Finds \"database-verification\" in skills_used - Exits with code 0 (allow) - No message to Claude 3. **Different session**: - New session ID = new state file - Hook blocks again ### Limitation The hook cannot detect when the skill is *actually* invoked - it just blocks once per session per skill. This means: - If Claude doesn't use the skill but makes a different edit, it won't block again - Trust that Claude follows the instruction - Future enhancement: detect actual Skill tool usage --- ## Performance Considerations ### Target Metrics - **UserPromptSubmit**: < 100ms - **PreToolUse**: < 200ms ### Performance Bottlenecks 1. **Loading skill-rules.json** (every execution) - Future: Cache in memory - Future: Watch for changes, reload only when needed 2. **Reading file content** (PreToolUse) - Only when contentPatterns configured - Only if file exists - Can be slow for large files 3. **Glob matching** (PreToolUse) - Regex compilation for each pattern - Future: Compile once, cache 4. **Regex matching** (Both hooks) - Intent patterns (UserPromptSubmit) - Content patterns (PreToolUse) - Future: Lazy compile, cache compiled regexes ### Optimization Strategies **Reduce patterns:** - Use more specific patterns (fewer to check) - Combine similar patterns where possible **File path patterns:** - More specific = fewer files to check - Example: form/src/services/** better than form/** **Content patterns:** - Only add when truly necessary - Simpler regex = faster matching --- **Related Files:** - [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) - Main skill guide - [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) - Debug hook issues - [SKILL_RULES_REFERENCE.md](SKILL_RULES_REFERENCE.md) - Configuration reference", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "skill-developer", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\skill-developer\\HOOK_MECHANISMS.md", "title": "HOOK_MECHANISMS"}}

UserPromptSubmit Hook** (Proactive Suggestions) - **File**: .claude/hooks/skill-activation-prompt.ts - **Trigger**: BEFORE Claude sees user's prompt - **Purpose**: Suggest relevant skills based on keywords + intent patterns - **Method**: Injects formatted reminder as context (stdout \u2192 Claude's input) - **Use Cases**: Topic-based skills, implicit work detection **2. Stop Hook - Error Handling Reminder** (Gentle Reminders) - **File**: .claude/hooks/error-handling-reminder.ts - **Trigger**: AFTER Claude finishes responding - **Purpose**: Gentle reminder to self-assess error handling in code written - **Method**: Analyzes edited files for risky patterns, displays reminder if needed - **Use Cases**: Error handling awareness without blocking friction **Philosophy Change (2025-10-27):** We moved away from blocking PreToolUse for Sentry/error handling. Instead, use gentle post-response reminders that don't block workflow but maintain code quality awareness. ### Configuration File **Location**: .claude/skills/skill-rules.json Defines: - All skills and their trigger conditions - Enforcement levels (block, suggest, warn) - File path patterns (glob) - Content detection patterns (regex) - Skip conditions (session tracking, file markers, env vars) --- ## Skill Types ### 1. Guardrail Skills **Purpose:** Enforce critical best practices that prevent errors **Characteristics:** - Type: \"guardrail\" - Enforcement: \"block\" - Priority: \"critical\" or \"high\" - Block file edits until skill used - Prevent common mistakes (column names, critical errors) - Session-aware (don't repeat nag in same session) **Examples:** - database-verification - Verify table/column names before Prisma queries - frontend-dev-guidelines - Enforce React/TypeScript patterns **When to Use:** - Mistakes that cause runtime errors - Data integrity concerns - Critical compatibility issues ### 2.

instead of .* - Test patterns thoroughly with regex tester (https://regex101.com/) - Don't make patterns too broad (causes false positives) - Don't make patterns too specific (causes false negatives) ### Common Pattern Examples --- ## File Path Triggers ### How It Works Glob pattern matching against the file path being edited. ### Use For Domain/area-specific activation based on file location in the project. ### Configuration ### Glob Pattern Syntax - ** = Any number of directories (including zero) - * = Any characters within a directory name - Examples: - frontend/src/**/*.tsx = All .tsx files in frontend/src and subdirs - **/schema.prisma = schema.prisma anywhere in project - form/src/**/*.ts = All .ts files in form/src subdirs ### Example - File being edited: frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx - Matches: frontend/src/**/*.tsx - Activates: frontend-dev-guidelines ### Best Practices - Be specific to avoid false positives - Use exclusions for test files: **/*.test.ts - Consider subdirectory structure - Test patterns with actual file paths - Use narrower patterns when possible: form/src/services/** not form/** ### Common Path Patterns --- ## Content Pattern Triggers ### How It Works Regex pattern matching against the file's actual content (what's inside the file). ### Use For Technology-specific activation based on what the code imports or uses (Prisma, controllers, specific libraries). ### Configuration ### Examples **Prisma Detection:** - File contains: import { PrismaService } from '@project/database' - Matches: import.*[Pp]risma - Activates: database-verification **Controller Detection:** - File contains: export class UserController { - Matches: export class.*Controller - Activates: error-tracking ### Best Practices - Match imports: import.*[Pp]risma (case-insensitive with [Pp]) - Escape special regex chars: \\\\.findMany\\\\( not .findMany( - Patterns use case-insensitive flag - Test against real file content - Make patterns specific enough to avoid false matches ### Common Content Patterns --- ## Best Practices Summary ### DO: \u2705 Use specific, unambiguous keywords \u2705 Test all patterns with real examples \u2705 Include common variations \u2705 Use non-greedy regex: .*? \u2705 Escape special characters in content patterns \u2705 Add exclusions for test files \u2705 Make file path patterns narrow and specific ### DON'T: \u274c Use overly generic keywords (\"system\", \"work\") \u274c Make intent patterns too broad (false positives) \u274c Make patterns too specific (false negatives) \u274c Forget to test with regex tester (https://regex101.com/) \u274c Use greedy regex: .* instead of .*?

Keywords Don't Match **Check:** - Look at promptTriggers.keywords in skill-rules.json - Are the keywords actually in your prompt? - Remember: case-insensitive substring matching **Example:** - \"how does the layout work?\" \u2192 \u2705 Matches \"layout\" - \"how does the grid system work?\" \u2192 \u2705 Matches \"grid\" - \"how do layouts work?\" \u2192 \u2705 Matches \"layout\" - \"how does it work?\" \u2192 \u274c No match **Fix:** Add more keyword variations to skill-rules.json #### 2. Intent Patterns Too Specific **Check:** - Look at promptTriggers.intentPatterns - Test regex at https://regex101.com/ - May need broader patterns **Example:** - \"create a database table\" \u2192 \u2705 Matches - \"add new table\" \u2192 \u274c Doesn't match (missing \"database\") **Fix:** Broaden the pattern: #### 3. Typo in Skill Name **Check:** - Skill name in SKILL.md frontmatter - Skill name in skill-rules.json - Must match exactly **Example:** **Fix:** Make names match exactly #### 4. JSON Syntax Error **Check:** If invalid JSON, jq will show the error. **Common errors:** - Trailing commas - Missing quotes - Single quotes instead of double - Unescaped characters in strings **Fix:** Correct JSON syntax, validate with jq #### Debug Command Test the hook manually: Expected: Your skill should appear in the output. --- ### PreToolUse Not Blocking **Symptoms:** Edit a file that should trigger a guardrail, but no block occurs. **Common Causes:** #### 1. File Path Doesn't Match Patterns **Check:** - File path being edited - fileTriggers.pathPatterns in skill-rules.json - Glob pattern syntax **Example:** - Editing: frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx \u2192 \u2705 Matches - Editing: frontend/tests/Dashboard.test.tsx \u2192 \u2705 Matches (add exclusion!) - Editing: backend/src/app.ts \u2192 \u274c Doesn't match **Fix:** Adjust glob patterns or add the missing path #### 2. Excluded by pathExclusions **Check:** - Are you editing a test file? - Look at fileTriggers.pathExclusions **Example:** - Editing: services/user.test.ts \u2192 \u274c Excluded - Editing: services/user.ts \u2192 \u2705 Not excluded **Fix:** If test exclusion too broad, narrow it or remove #### 3. Content Pattern Not Found **Check:** - Does the file actually contain the pattern? - Look at fileTriggers.contentPatterns - Is the regex correct? **Example:** - File has: import { PrismaService } from './prisma' \u2192 \u2705 Matches - File has: import { Database } from './db' \u2192 \u274c Doesn't match **Debug:** **Fix:** Adjust content patterns or add missing imports #### 4. Session Already Used Skill **Check session state:** **Example:** If the skill is in skills_used, it won't block again in this session. **Fix:** Delete the state file to reset: #### 5. File Marker Present **Check file for skip marker:** If found, the file is permanently skipped. **Fix:** Remove the marker if verification is needed again #### 6. Environment Variable Override **Check:** If set, the skill is disabled. **Fix:** Unset the environment variable: #### Debug Command Test the hook manually: Expected: - Exit code 2 + stderr message if should block - Exit code 0 + no output if should allow --- ## False Positives **Symptoms:** Skill triggers when it shouldn't. **Common Causes & Solutions:** ### 1. Keywords Too Generic **Problem:** - Triggers on: \"user manual\", \"file system\", \"create directory\" **Solution:** Make keywords more specific ### 2. Intent Patterns Too Broad **Problem:** - Triggers on: \"create file\", \"create folder\", \"create account\" **Solution:** Add context to patterns **Advanced:** Use negative lookaheads to exclude ### 3. File Paths Too Generic **Problem:** - Triggers on: test files, config files, everything **Solution:** Use narrower patterns ### 4. Content Patterns Catching Unrelated Code **Problem:** - Triggers on: // Don't use Prisma here - Triggers on: const note = \"Prisma is cool\" **Solution:** Make patterns more specific ### 5. Adjust Enforcement Level **Last resort:** If false positives are frequent: This makes it advisory instead of blocking. --- ## Hook Not Executing **Symptoms:** Hook doesn't run at all - no suggestion, no block. **Common Causes:** ### 1. Hook Not Registered **Check .claude/settings.json:** Expected: Hook entries present **Fix:** Add missing hook registration: ### 2. Bash Wrapper Not Executable **Check:** Expected: -rwxr-xr-x (executable) **Fix:** ### 3. Incorrect Shebang **Check:** Expected: #!/bin/bash **Fix:** Add correct shebang to first line ### 4. npx/tsx Not Available **Check:** Expected: Version number **Fix:** Install dependencies: ### 5. TypeScript Compilation Error **Check:** Expected: No output (no errors) **Fix:** Correct TypeScript syntax errors --- ## Performance Issues **Symptoms:** Hooks are slow, noticeable delay before prompt/edit. **Common Causes:** ### 1. Too Many Patterns **Check:** - Count patterns in skill-rules.json - Each pattern = regex compilation + matching **Solution:** Reduce patterns - Combine similar patterns - Remove redundant patterns - Use more specific patterns (faster matching) ### 2. Complex Regex **Problem:** - Long alternations = slow **Solution:** Simplify ### 3. Too Many Files Checked **Problem:** **Solution:** Be more specific ### 4. Large Files Content pattern matching reads entire file - slow for large files. **Solution:** - Only use content patterns when necessary - Consider file size limits (future enhancement) ### Measure Performance **Target metrics:** - UserPromptSubmit: < 100ms - PreToolUse: < 200ms --- **Related Files:** - [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) - Main skill guide - [HOOK_MECHANISMS.md](HOOK_MECHANISMS.md) - How hooks work - [SKILL_RULES_REFERENCE.md](SKILL_RULES_REFERENCE.md) - Configuration reference", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "skill-developer", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\skill-developer\\TROUBLESHOOTING.md", "title": "TROUBLESHOOTING"}}

Use when: slack bot, slack app, bolt framework, block kit, slash command.\" source: vibeship-spawner-skills (Apache 2.0) --- # Slack Bot Builder ## Patterns ### Bolt App Foundation Pattern The Bolt framework is Slack's recommended approach for building apps. It handles authentication, event routing, request verification, and HTTP request processing so you can focus on app logic. Key benefits: - Event handling in a few lines of code - Security checks and payload validation built-in - Organized, consistent patterns - Works for experiments and production Available in: Python, JavaScript (Node.js), Java **When to use**: ['Starting any new Slack app', 'Migrating from legacy Slack APIs', 'Building production Slack integrations'] ### Block Kit UI Pattern Block Kit is Slack's UI framework for building rich, interactive messages. Compose messages using blocks (sections, actions, inputs) and elements (buttons, menus, text inputs). Limits: - Up to 50 blocks per message - Up to 100 blocks in modals/Home tabs - Block text limited to 3000 characters Use Block Kit Builder to prototype: https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder **When to use**: ['Building rich message layouts', 'Adding interactive components to messages', 'Creating forms in modals', 'Building Home tab experiences'] ### OAuth Installation Pattern Enable users to install your app in their workspaces via OAuth 2.0. Bolt handles most of the OAuth flow, but you need to configure it and store tokens securely. Key OAuth concepts: - Scopes define permissions (request minimum needed) - Tokens are workspace-specific - Installation data must be stored persistently - Users can add scopes later (additive) 70% of users abandon installation when confronted with excessive permission requests - request only what you need! **When to use**: ['Distributing app to multiple workspaces', 'Building public Slack apps', 'Enterprise-grade integrations'] ## \u26a0\ufe0f Sharp Edges | Issue | Severity | Solution | |-------|----------|----------| | Issue | critical | ## Acknowledge immediately, process later | | Issue | critical | ## Proper state validation | | Issue | critical | ## Never hardcode or log tokens | | Issue | high | ## Request minimum required scopes | | Issue | medium | ## Know and respect the limits | | Issue | high | ## Socket Mode: Only for development | | Issue | critical | ## Bolt handles this automatically |", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "slack-bot-builder", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\slack-bot-builder\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

Provides constraints, validation tools, and animation concepts. Use when users request animated GIFs for Slack like \"make me a GIF of X doing Y for Slack.\" license: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt --- # Slack GIF Creator A toolkit providing utilities and knowledge for creating animated GIFs optimized for Slack. ## Slack Requirements **Dimensions:** - Emoji GIFs: 128x128 (recommended) - Message GIFs: 480x480 **Parameters:** - FPS: 10-30 (lower is smaller file size) - Colors: 48-128 (fewer = smaller file size) - Duration: Keep under 3 seconds for emoji GIFs ## Core Workflow ## Drawing Graphics ### Working with User-Uploaded Images If a user uploads an image, consider whether they want to: - **Use it directly** (e.g., \"animate this\", \"split this into frames\") - **Use it as inspiration** (e.g., \"make something like this\") Load and work with images using PIL: ### Drawing from Scratch When drawing graphics from scratch, use PIL ImageDraw primitives: **Don't use:** Emoji fonts (unreliable across platforms) or assume pre-packaged graphics exist in this skill. ### Making Graphics Look Good Graphics should look polished and creative, not basic. Here's how: **Use thicker lines** - Always set width=2 or higher for outlines and lines. Thin lines (width=1) look choppy and amateurish. **Add visual depth**: - Use gradients for backgrounds (create_gradient_background) - Layer multiple shapes for complexity (e.g., a star with a smaller star inside) **Make shapes more interesting**: - Don't just draw a plain circle - add highlights, rings, or patterns - Stars can have glows (draw larger, semi-transparent versions behind) - Combine multiple shapes (stars + sparkles, circles + rings) **Pay attention to colors**: - Use vibrant, complementary colors - Add contrast (dark outlines on light shapes, light outlines on dark shapes) - Consider the overall composition **For complex shapes** (hearts, snowflakes, etc.): - Use combinations of polygons and ellipses - Calculate points carefully for symmetry - Add details (a heart can have a highlight curve, snowflakes have intricate branches) Be creative and detailed! A good Slack GIF should look polished, not like placeholder graphics. ## Available Utilities ### GIFBuilder (core.gif_builder) Assembles frames and optimizes for Slack: ### Validators (core.validators) Check if GIF meets Slack requirements: ### Easing Functions (core.easing) Smooth motion instead of linear: ### Frame Helpers (core.frame_composer) Convenience functions for common needs: ## Animation Concepts ### Shake/Vibrate Offset object position with oscillation: - Use math.sin() or math.cos() with frame index - Add small random variations for natural feel - Apply to x and/or y position ### Pulse/Heartbeat Scale object size rhythmically: - Use math.sin(t * frequency * 2 * math.pi) for smooth pulse - For heartbeat: two quick pulses then pause (adjust sine wave) - Scale between 0.8 and 1.2 of base size ### Bounce Object falls and bounces: - Use interpolate() with easing='bounce_out' for landing - Use easing='ease_in' for falling (accelerating) - Apply gravity by increasing y velocity each frame ### Spin/Rotate Rotate object around center: - PIL: image.rotate(angle, resample=Image.BICUBIC) - For wobble: use sine wave for angle instead of linear ### Fade In/Out Gradually appear or disappear: - Create RGBA image, adjust alpha channel - Or use Image.blend(image1, image2, alpha) - Fade in: alpha from 0 to 1 - Fade out: alpha from 1 to 0 ### Slide Move object from off-screen to position: - Start position: outside frame bounds - End position: target location - Use interpolate() with easing='ease_out' for smooth stop - For overshoot: use easing='back_out' ### Zoom Scale and position for zoom effect: - Zoom in: scale from 0.1 to 2.0, crop center - Zoom out: scale from 2.0 to 1.0 - Can add motion blur for drama (PIL filter) ### Explode/Particle Burst Create particles radiating outward: - Generate particles with random angles and velocities - Update each particle: x += vx, y += vy - Add gravity: vy += gravity_constant - Fade out particles over time (reduce alpha) ## Optimization Strategies Only when asked to make the file size smaller, implement a few of the following methods: 1. **Fewer frames** - Lower FPS (10 instead of 20) or shorter duration 2. **Fewer colors** - num_colors=48 instead of 128 3. **Smaller dimensions** - 128x128 instead of 480x480 4. **Remove duplicates** - remove_duplicates=True in save() 5. **Emoji mode** - optimize_for_emoji=True auto-optimizes ## Philosophy This skill provides: - **Knowledge**: Slack's requirements and animation concepts - **Utilities**: GIFBuilder, validators, easing functions - **Flexibility**: Create the animation logic using PIL primitives It does NOT provide: - Rigid animation templates or pre-made functions - Emoji font rendering (unreliable across platforms) - A library of pre-packaged graphics built into the skill **Note on user uploads**: This skill doesn't include pre-built graphics, but if a user uploads an image, use PIL to load and work with it - interpret based on their request whether they want it used directly or just as inspiration. Be creative! Combine concepts (bouncing + rotating, pulsing + sliding, etc.) and use PIL's full capabilities. ## Dependencies", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "slack-gif-creator", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\slack-gif-creator\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

Review content pillar topics 2. Write 5 LinkedIn posts 3. Write 3 Twitter threads + daily tweets 4. Create Instagram carousel + Reel ideas 5. Schedule everything 6. Leave room for real-time engagement --- ## Engagement Strategy ### Proactive Engagement Engagement isn't just responding\u2014it's actively participating: **Daily engagement routine (30 min):** 1. Respond to all comments on your posts (5 min) 2. Comment on 5-10 posts from target accounts (15 min) 3. Share/repost with added insight (5 min) 4. Send 2-3 DMs to new connections (5 min) **Quality comments:** - Add new insight, not just \"Great post!\" - Share a related experience - Ask a thoughtful follow-up question - Respectfully disagree with nuance ### Building Relationships - Identify 20-50 accounts in your space - Consistently engage with their content - Share their content with credit - Eventually collaborate (podcasts, co-created content) ### Handling Negative Comments - Respond calmly and professionally - Don't get defensive - Take legitimate criticism offline - Block/mute trolls without engaging - Let community defend you when appropriate --- ## Analytics & Optimization ### Metrics That Matter **Awareness:** - Impressions - Reach - Follower growth rate **Engagement:** - Engagement rate (engagements / impressions) - Comments (higher value than likes) - Shares/reposts - Saves (Instagram) **Conversion:** - Link clicks - Profile visits - DMs received - Leads/conversions attributed ### What to Track Weekly - [ ] Top 3 performing posts (why did they work?) - [ ] Bottom 3 posts (what can you learn?) - [ ] Follower growth trend - [ ] Engagement rate trend - [ ] Best posting times (from data) - [ ] Content pillar performance ### Optimization Actions **If engagement is low:** - Test new hooks - Post at different times - Try different formats (carousel vs. text) - Increase native engagement with others - Check if content matches audience interest **If reach is declining:** - Avoid external links in post body - Increase posting frequency slightly - Engage more in comments - Test video/visual content - Check for algorithm changes --- ## Platform-Specific Tips ### LinkedIn Algorithm Tips - First hour engagement matters most - Comments > reactions > clicks - Dwell time (people reading) signals quality - No external links in post body - Document posts (carousels) get strong reach - Polls drive engagement but don't build authority ### Twitter/X Algorithm Tips - Replies and quote tweets build authority - Threads keep people on platform (rewarded) - Images and video get more reach - Engagement in first 30 min matters - Twitter Blue/Premium may boost reach ### Instagram Algorithm Tips - Reels heavily prioritized over static posts - Saves and shares > likes - Stories keep you top of feed - Consistency matters more than perfection - Use all features (polls, questions, etc.) --- ## Content Ideas by Situation ### When You're Starting Out - Document your journey - Share what you're learning - Curate and comment on industry content - Ask questions to your audience - Engage heavily with established accounts ### When You're Established - Share original data and insights - Tell customer success stories - Take stronger positions - Create signature frameworks - Collaborate with peers ### When You're Stuck - Repurpose old high-performing content - Ask your audience what they want - Comment on industry news - Share a failure or lesson learned - Interview someone and share insights --- ## Scheduling Best Practices ### When to Schedule vs. Post Live **Schedule:** - Core content posts - Threads - Carousels - Evergreen content **Post live:** - Real-time commentary - Responses to news/trends - Engagement with others - Anything requiring immediate interaction ### Queue Management - Maintain 1-2 weeks of scheduled content - Review queue weekly for relevance - Leave gaps for spontaneous posts - Adjust timing based on performance data --- ## Reverse Engineering Viral Content Instead of guessing what works, systematically analyze top-performing content in your niche and extract proven patterns. ### The 6-Step Framework #### 1. NICHE ID \u2014 Find Top Creators Identify 10-20 creators in your space who consistently get high engagement: **Selection criteria:** - Posting consistently (3+ times/week) - High engagement rate relative to follower count - Audience overlap with your target market - Mix of established and rising creators **Where to find them:** - LinkedIn: Search by industry keywords, check \"People also viewed\" - Twitter/X: Check who your target audience follows and engages with - Use tools like SparkToro, Followerwonk, or manual research - Look at who gets featured in industry newsletters #### 2. SCRAPE \u2014 Collect Posts at Scale Gather 500-1000+ posts from your identified creators for analysis: **Tools:** - **Apify** \u2014 LinkedIn scraper, Twitter scraper actors - **Phantom Buster** \u2014 Multi-platform automation - **Export tools** \u2014 Platform-specific export features - **Manual collection** \u2014 For smaller datasets, copy/paste into spreadsheet **Data to collect:** - Post text/content - Engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares, saves) - Post format (text-only, carousel, video, image) - Posting time/day - Hook/first line - CTA used - Topic/theme #### 3. ANALYZE \u2014 Extract What Actually Works Sort and analyze the data to find patterns: **Quantitative analysis:** - Rank posts by engagement rate - Identify top 10% performers - Look for format patterns (do carousels outperform?) - Check timing patterns (best days/times) - Compare topic performance **Qualitative analysis:** - What hooks do top posts use? - How long are high-performing posts? - What emotional triggers appear? - What formats repeat? - What topics consistently perform? **Questions to answer:** - What's the average length of top posts? - Which hook types appear most in top 10%? - What CTAs drive most comments? - What topics get saved/shared most? #### 4. PLAYBOOK \u2014 Codify Patterns Document repeatable patterns you can use: **Hook patterns to codify:** **Format patterns:** - Carousel: Hook slide \u2192 Problem \u2192 Solution steps \u2192 CTA - Thread: Hook \u2192 Promise \u2192 Deliver \u2192 Recap \u2192 CTA - Story post: Hook \u2192 Setup \u2192 Conflict \u2192 Resolution \u2192 Lesson **CTA patterns:** - Question: \"What would you add?\" - Agreement: \"Agree or disagree?\" - Share: \"Tag someone who needs this\" - Save: \"Save this for later\" #### 5. LAYER VOICE \u2014 Apply Direct Response Principles Take proven patterns and make them yours with these voice principles: **\"Smart friend who figured something out\"** - Write like you're texting advice to a friend - Share discoveries, not lectures - Use \"I found that...\" not \"You should...\" - Be helpful, not preachy **Specific > Vague** **Short. Breathe. Land.** - One idea per sentence - Use line breaks liberally - Let important points stand alone - Create rhythm: short, short, longer explanation **Write from emotion** - Start with how you felt, not what you did - Use emotional words: frustrated, excited, terrified, obsessed - Show vulnerability when authentic - Connect the feeling to the lesson #### 6. CONVERT \u2014 Turn Attention into Action Bridge from engagement to business results: **Soft conversions:** - Newsletter signups in bio/comments - Free resource offers in follow-up comments - DM triggers (\"Comment X and I'll send you...\") - Profile visits \u2192 optimized profile with clear CTA **Direct conversions:** - Link in comments (not post body on LinkedIn) - Contextual product mentions within valuable content - Case study posts that naturally showcase your work - \"If you want help with this, DM me\" (sparingly) ### Output: Proven Patterns + Right Voice = Performance The formula: ### Reverse Engineering Checklist - [ ] Identified 10-20 top creators in niche - [ ] Collected 500+ posts for analysis - [ ] Ranked by engagement rate - [ ] Documented top 10 hook patterns - [ ] Documented top 5 format patterns - [ ] Documented top 5 CTA patterns - [ ] Created voice guidelines (specificity, brevity, emotion) - [ ] Built template library from patterns - [ ] Set up tracking for your own content performance --- ## Questions to Ask If you need more context: 1. What platform(s) are you focusing on? 2. What's your current posting frequency? 3. Do you have existing content to repurpose? 4. What content has performed well in the past? 5. How much time can you dedicate weekly? 6. Are you building personal brand, company brand, or both? --- ## Related Skills - **copywriting**: For longer-form content that feeds social - **launch-strategy**: For coordinating social with launches - **email-sequence**: For nurturing social audience via email - **marketing-psychology**: For understanding what drives engagement", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "social-content", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\social-content\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}
{"id": "skill_softwarearchitecture_skill", "text": "--- name: software-architecture description: Guide for quality focused software architecture. This skill should be used when users want to write code, design architecture, analyze code, in any case that relates to software development. --- # Software Architecture Development Skill This skill provides guidance for quality focused software development and architecture. It is based on Clean Architecture and Domain Driven Design principles. ## Code Style Rules ### General Principles - **Early return pattern**: Always use early returns when possible, over nested conditions for better readability - Avoid code duplication through creation of reusable functions and modules - Decompose long (more than 80 lines of code) components and functions into multiple smaller components and functions. If they cannot be used anywhere else, keep it in the same file. But if file longer than 200 lines of code, it should be split into multiple files. - Use arrow functions instead of function declarations when possible ### Best Practices #### Library-First Approach - **ALWAYS search for existing solutions before writing custom code** - Check npm for existing libraries that solve the problem - Evaluate existing services/SaaS solutions - Consider third-party APIs for common functionality - Use libraries instead of writing your own utils or helpers. For example, use cockatiel instead of writing your own retry logic. - **When custom code IS justified:** - Specific business logic unique to the domain - Performance-critical paths with special requirements - When external dependencies would be overkill - Security-sensitive code requiring full control - When existing solutions don't meet requirements after thorough evaluation #### Architecture and Design - **Clean Architecture & DDD Principles:** - Follow domain-driven design and ubiquitous language - Separate domain entities from infrastructure concerns - Keep business logic independent of frameworks - Define use cases clearly and keep them isolated - **Naming Conventions:** - **AVOID** generic names: utils, helpers, common, shared - **USE** domain-specific names: OrderCalculator, UserAuthenticator, InvoiceGenerator - Follow bounded context naming patterns - Each module should have a single, clear purpose - **Separation of Concerns:** - Do NOT mix business logic with UI components - Keep database queries out of controllers - Maintain clear boundaries between contexts - Ensure proper separation of responsibilities #### Anti-Patterns to Avoid - **NIH (Not Invented Here) Syndrome:** - Don't build custom auth when Auth0/Supabase exists - Don't write custom state management instead of using Redux/Zustand - Don't create custom form validation instead of using established libraries - **Poor Architectural Choices:** - Mixing business logic with UI components - Database queries directly in controllers - Lack of clear separation of concerns - **Generic Naming Anti-Patterns:** - utils.js with 50 unrelated functions - helpers/misc.js as a dumping ground - common/shared.js with unclear purpose - Remember: Every line of custom code is a liability that needs maintenance, testing, and documentation #### Code Quality - Proper error handling with typed catch blocks - Break down complex logic into smaller, reusable functions - Avoid deep nesting (max 3 levels) - Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible - Keep files focused and under 200 lines of code when possible", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "software-architecture", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\software-architecture\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}
{"id": "skill_sqlinjectiontesting_skill", "text": "--- name: SQL Injection Testing description: This skill should be used when the user asks to \"test for SQL injection vulnerabilities\", \"perform SQLi attacks\", \"bypass authentication using SQL injection\", \"extract database information through injection\", \"detect SQL injection flaws\", or \"exploit database query vulnerabilities\". It provides comprehensive techniques for identifying, exploiting, and understanding SQL injection attack vectors across different database systems. metadata: author: zebbern version: \"1.1\" --- # SQL Injection Testing ## Purpose Execute comprehensive SQL injection vulnerability assessments on web applications to identify database security flaws, demonstrate exploitation techniques, and validate input sanitization mechanisms. This skill enables systematic detection and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities across in-band, blind, and out-of-band attack vectors to assess application security posture. ## Inputs / Prerequisites ### Required Access - Target web application URL with injectable parameters - Burp Suite or equivalent proxy tool for request manipulation - SQLMap installation for automated exploitation - Browser with developer tools enabled ### Technical Requirements - Understanding of SQL query syntax (MySQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle) - Knowledge of HTTP request/response cycle - Familiarity with database schemas and structures - Write permissions for testing reports ### Legal Prerequisites - Written authorization for penetration testing - Defined scope including target URLs and parameters - Emergency contact procedures established - Data handling agreements in place ## Outputs / Deliverables ### Primary Outputs - SQL injection vulnerability report with severity ratings - Extracted database schemas and table structures - Authentication bypass proof-of-concept demonstrations - Remediation recommendations with code examples ### Evidence Artifacts - Screenshots of successful injections - HTTP request/response logs - Database dumps (sanitized) - Payload documentation ## Core Workflow ### Phase 1: Detection and Reconnaissance #### Identify Injectable Parameters Locate user-controlled input fields that interact with database queries: #### Test for Basic Vulnerability Indicators Insert special characters to trigger error responses: Monitor application responses for: - Database error messages revealing query structure - Unexpected application behavior changes - HTTP 500 Internal Server errors - Modified response content or length #### Logic Testing Payloads Verify boolean-based vulnerability presence: Compare responses between true and false conditions to confirm injection capability. ### Phase 2: Exploitation Techniques #### UNION-Based Extraction Combine attacker-controlled SELECT statements with original query: #### Error-Based Extraction Force database errors that leak information: #### Blind Boolean-Based Extraction Infer data through application behavior changes: #### Time-Based Blind Extraction Use database sleep functions for confirmation: #### Out-of-Band (OOB) Extraction Exfiltrate data through external channels: ### Phase 3: Authentication Bypass #### Login Form Exploitation Craft payloads to bypass credential verification: Query transformation example: ### Phase 4: Filter Bypass Techniques #### Character Encoding Bypass When special characters are blocked: #### Whitespace Bypass Substitute blocked spaces: #### Keyword Bypass Evade blacklisted SQL keywords: ## Quick Reference ### Detection Test Sequence ### Database Fingerprinting ### Information Schema Queries ### Common Payloads Quick List | Purpose | Payload | |---------|---------| | Basic test | ' or \" | | Boolean true | OR 1=1-- | | Boolean false | AND 1=2-- | | Comment (MySQL) | # or -- | | Comment (MSSQL) | -- | | UNION probe | UNION SELECT NULL-- | | Time delay | AND SLEEP(5)-- | | Auth bypass | ' OR '1'='1 | ## Constraints and Guardrails ### Operational Boundaries - Never execute destructive queries (DROP, DELETE, TRUNCATE) without explicit authorization - Limit data extraction to proof-of-concept quantities - Avoid denial-of-service through resource-intensive queries - Stop immediately upon detecting production database with real user data ### Technical Limitations - WAF/IPS may block common payloads requiring evasion techniques - Parameterized queries prevent standard injection - Some blind injection requires extensive requests (rate limiting concerns) - Second-order injection requires understanding of data flow ### Legal and Ethical Requirements - Written scope agreement must exist before testing - Document all extracted data and handle per data protection requirements - Report critical vulnerabilities immediately through agreed channels - Never access data beyond scope requirements ## Examples ### Example 1: E-commerce Product Page SQLi **Scenario**: Testing product display page with ID parameter **Initial Request**: **Detection Test**: **Column Enumeration**: **Data Extraction**: ### Example 2: Blind Time-Based Extraction **Scenario**: No visible output, testing for blind injection **Confirm Vulnerability**: **Extract Database Name Length**: **Extract Characters**: ### Example 3: Login Bypass **Target**: Admin login form **Standard Login Query**: **Injection Payload**: **Resulting Query**: **Result**: Password check bypassed, authenticated as administrator. ## Troubleshooting ### No Error Messages Displayed - Application uses generic error handling - Switch to blind injection techniques (boolean or time-based) - Monitor response length differences instead of content ### UNION Injection Fails - Column count may be incorrect \u2192 Test with ORDER BY - Data types may mismatch \u2192 Use NULL for all columns first - Results may not display \u2192 Find injectable column positions ### WAF Blocking Requests - Use encoding techniques (URL, hex, unicode) - Insert inline comments within keywords - Try alternative syntax for same operations - Fragment payload across multiple parameters ### Payload Not Executing - Verify correct comment syntax for database type - Check if application uses parameterized queries - Confirm input reaches SQL query (not filtered client-side) - Test different injection points (headers, cookies) ### Time-Based Injection Inconsistent - Network latency may cause false positives - Use longer delays (10+ seconds) for clarity - Run multiple tests to confirm pattern - Consider server-side caching effects", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "sql-injection-testing", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\sql-injection-testing\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

But that single check can be bypassed by different code paths, refactoring, or mocks. **Core principle:** Validate at EVERY layer data passes through. Make the bug structurally impossible. ## Why Multiple Layers Single validation: \"We fixed the bug\" Multiple layers: \"We made the bug impossible\" Different layers catch different cases: - Entry validation catches most bugs - Business logic catches edge cases - Environment guards prevent context-specific dangers - Debug logging helps when other layers fail ## The Four Layers ### Layer 1: Entry Point Validation **Purpose:** Reject obviously invalid input at API boundary ### Layer 2: Business Logic Validation **Purpose:** Ensure data makes sense for this operation ### Layer 3: Environment Guards **Purpose:** Prevent dangerous operations in specific contexts ### Layer 4: Debug Instrumentation **Purpose:** Capture context for forensics ## Applying the Pattern When you find a bug: 1. **Trace the data flow** - Where does bad value originate? Where used? 2. **Map all checkpoints** - List every point data passes through 3. **Add validation at each layer** - Entry, business, environment, debug 4. **Test each layer** - Try to bypass layer 1, verify layer 2 catches it ## Example from Session Bug: Empty projectDir caused git init in source code **Data flow:** 1.

{"id": "skill_systematicdebugging_rootcausetracing", "text": "# Root Cause Tracing ## Overview Bugs often manifest deep in the call stack (git init in wrong directory, file created in wrong location, database opened with wrong path). Your instinct is to fix where the error appears, but that's treating a symptom. **Core principle:** Trace backward through the call chain until you find the original trigger, then fix at the source. ## When to Use **Use when:** - Error happens deep in execution (not at entry point) - Stack trace shows long call chain - Unclear where invalid data originated - Need to find which test/code triggers the problem ## The Tracing Process ### 1. Observe the Symptom ### 2. Find Immediate Cause **What code directly causes this?** ### 3. Ask: What Called This? ### 4. Keep Tracing Up **What value was passed?** - projectDir = '' (empty string!) - Empty string as cwd resolves to process.cwd() - That's the source code directory! ### 5. Find Original Trigger **Where did empty string come from?** ## Adding Stack Traces When you can't trace manually, add instrumentation: **Critical:** Use console.error() in tests (not logger - may not show) **Run and capture:** **Analyze stack traces:** - Look for test file names - Find the line number triggering the call - Identify the pattern (same test? same parameter?) ## Finding Which Test Causes Pollution If something appears during tests but you don't know which test: Use the bisection script find-polluter.sh in this directory: Runs tests one-by-one, stops at first polluter.

{"id": "skill_systematicdebugging_skill", "text": "--- name: systematic-debugging description: Use when encountering any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior, before proposing fixes --- # Systematic Debugging ## Overview Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues. **Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure. **Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.** ## The Iron Law If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes. ## When to Use Use for ANY technical issue: - Test failures - Bugs in production - Unexpected behavior - Performance problems - Build failures - Integration issues **Use this ESPECIALLY when:** - Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting) - \"Just one quick fix\" seems obvious - You've already tried multiple fixes - Previous fix didn't work - You don't fully understand the issue **Don't skip when:** - Issue seems simple (simple bugs have root causes too) - You're in a hurry (rushing guarantees rework) - Manager wants it fixed NOW (systematic is faster than thrashing) ## The Four Phases You MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next. ### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation **BEFORE attempting ANY fix:** 1. **Read Error Messages Carefully** - Don't skip past errors or warnings - They often contain the exact solution - Read stack traces completely - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes 2. **Reproduce Consistently** - Can you trigger it reliably? - What are the exact steps? - Does it happen every time? - If not reproducible \u2192 gather more data, don't guess 3. **Check Recent Changes** - What changed that could cause this? - Git diff, recent commits - New dependencies, config changes - Environmental differences 4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems** **WHEN system has multiple components (CI \u2192 build \u2192 signing, API \u2192 service \u2192 database):** **BEFORE proposing fixes, add diagnostic instrumentation:** **Example (multi-layer system):** **This reveals:** Which layer fails (secrets \u2192 workflow \u2713, workflow \u2192 build \u2717) 5. **Trace Data Flow** **WHEN error is deep in call stack:** See root-cause-tracing.md in this directory for the complete backward tracing technique. **Quick version:** - Where does bad value originate? - What called this with bad value? - Keep tracing up until you find the source - Fix at source, not at symptom ### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis **Find the pattern before fixing:** 1. **Find Working Examples** - Locate similar working code in same codebase - What works that's similar to what's broken? 2. **Compare Against References** - If implementing pattern, read reference implementation COMPLETELY - Don't skim - read every line - Understand the pattern fully before applying 3. **Identify Differences** - What's different between working and broken? - List every difference, however small - Don't assume \"that can't matter\" 4. **Understand Dependencies** - What other components does this need? - What settings, config, environment? - What assumptions does it make? ### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing **Scientific method:** 1. **Form Single Hypothesis** - State clearly: \"I think X is the root cause because Y\" - Write it down - Be specific, not vague 2. **Test Minimally** - Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis - One variable at a time - Don't fix multiple things at once 3. **Verify Before Continuing** - Did it work? Yes \u2192 Phase 4 - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis - DON'T add more fixes on top 4. **When You Don't Know** - Say \"I don't understand X\" - Don't pretend to know - Ask for help - Research more ### Phase 4: Implementation **Fix the root cause, not the symptom:** 1. **Create Failing Test Case** - Simplest possible reproduction - Automated test if possible - One-off test script if no framework - MUST have before fixing - Use the superpowers:test-driven-development skill for writing proper failing tests 2. **Implement Single Fix** - Address the root cause identified - ONE change at a time - No \"while I'm here\" improvements - No bundled refactoring 3. **Verify Fix** - Test passes now? - No other tests broken? - Issue actually resolved? 4. **If Fix Doesn't Work** - STOP - Count: How many fixes have you tried? - If < 3: Return to Phase 1, re-analyze with new information - **If \u2265 3: STOP and question the architecture (step 5 below)** - DON'T attempt Fix #4 without architectural discussion 5. **If 3+ Fixes Failed: Question Architecture** **Pattern indicating architectural problem:** - Each fix reveals new shared state/coupling/problem in different place - Fixes require \"massive refactoring\" to implement - Each fix creates new symptoms elsewhere **STOP and question fundamentals:** - Is this pattern fundamentally sound? - Are we \"sticking with it through sheer inertia\"? - Should we refactor architecture vs. continue fixing symptoms? **Discuss with your human partner before attempting more fixes** This is NOT a failed hypothesis - this is a wrong architecture. ## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process If you catch yourself thinking: - \"Quick fix for now, investigate later\" - \"Just try changing X and see if it works\" - \"Add multiple changes, run tests\" - \"Skip the test, I'll manually verify\" - \"It's probably X, let me fix that\" - \"I don't fully understand but this might work\" - \"Pattern says X but I'll adapt it differently\" - \"Here are the main problems: [lists fixes without investigation]\" - Proposing solutions before tracing data flow - **\"One more fix attempt\" (when already tried 2+)** - **Each fix reveals new problem in different place** **ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.** **If 3+ fixes failed:** Question the architecture (see Phase 4.5) ## your human partner's Signals You're Doing It Wrong **Watch for these redirections:** - \"Is that not happening?\" - You assumed without verifying - \"Will it show us...?\" - You should have added evidence gathering - \"Stop guessing\" - You're proposing fixes without understanding - \"Ultrathink this\" - Question fundamentals, not just symptoms - \"We're stuck?\" (frustrated) - Your approach isn't working **When you see these:** STOP. Return to Phase 1. ## Common Rationalizations | Excuse | Reality | |--------|---------| | \"Issue is simple, don't need process\" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. | | \"Emergency, no time for process\" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. | | \"Just try this first, then investigate\" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. | | \"I'll write test after confirming fix works\" | Untested fixes don't stick. Test first proves it. | | \"Multiple fixes at once saves time\" | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. | | \"Reference too long, I'll adapt the pattern\" | Partial understanding guarantees bugs. Read it completely. | | \"I see the problem, let me fix it\" | Seeing symptoms \u2260 understanding root cause. | | \"One more fix attempt\" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Question pattern, don't fix again. | ## Quick Reference | Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria | |-------|---------------|------------------| | **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence | Understand WHAT and WHY | | **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences | | **3. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis | | **4. Implementation** | Create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, tests pass | ## When Process Reveals \"No Root Cause\" If systematic investigation reveals issue is truly environmental, timing-dependent, or external: 1. You've completed the process 2. Document what you investigated 3. Implement appropriate handling (retry, timeout, error message) 4. Add monitoring/logging for future investigation **But:** 95% of \"no root cause\" cases are incomplete investigation. ## Supporting Techniques These techniques are part of systematic debugging and available in this directory: - **root-cause-tracing.md** - Trace bugs backward through call stack to find original trigger - **defense-in-depth.md** - Add validation at multiple layers after finding root cause - **condition-based-waiting.md** - Replace arbitrary timeouts with condition polling **Related skills:** - **superpowers:test-driven-development** - For creating failing test case (Phase 4, Step 1) - **superpowers:verification-before-completion** - Verify fix worked before claiming success ## Real-World Impact From debugging sessions: - Systematic approach: 15-30 minutes to fix - Random fixes approach: 2-3 hours of thrashing - First-time fix rate: 95% vs 40% - New bugs introduced: Near zero vs common", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "systematic-debugging", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\systematic-debugging\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

Customer says they changed nothing on their end. FIX IT NOW.\" You quickly check the logs and see: You remember that last week, another service had timeout issues and adding a retry fixed it. That took 2 minutes to implement. **The systematic debugging skill says you must:** 1. Read error messages carefully \u2713 (you did) 2. Reproduce consistently (would take ~10 min to set up test environment) 3. Check recent changes (would take ~15 min to review PRs) 4. Find working examples (would take ~10 min) 5. Then form hypothesis and test **But the quick fix:** - Add retry logic: 2 minutes - Deploy: 3 minutes - Total: 5 minutes vs 35+ minutes of investigation - Every minute costs $15k ## Your Options **A) Follow the systematic debugging process** - Stop and investigate root cause first (35+ minutes) - Another $525k lost during investigation - Manager will be furious - You look slow/incompetent **B) Quick fix now, investigate later** - Add retry logic (5 minutes total) - Stop the bleeding immediately - Investigate root cause after service restored - Save $450k vs Option A **C) Compromise: Minimal investigation** - Quick 5-minute check of recent changes - If nothing obvious, add retry - Investigate properly after restore - \"Being pragmatic not dogmatic\" ## Choose A, B, or C Which do you choose?

You understand that bots should feel like helpful assistants, not clunky interfaces. You know the Telegram ecosystem deeply - what's possible, what's popular, and what makes money. You design conversations that feel natural. ## Capabilities - Telegram Bot API - Bot architecture - Command design - Inline keyboards - Bot monetization - User onboarding - Bot analytics - Webhook management ## Patterns ### Bot Architecture Structure for maintainable Telegram bots **When to use**: When starting a new bot project javascript import { Telegraf } from 'telegraf'; const bot = new Telegraf(process.env.BOT_TOKEN); // Command handlers bot.start((ctx) => ctx.reply('Welcome!')); bot.help((ctx) => ctx.reply('How can I help?')); // Text handler bot.on('text', (ctx) => { ctx.reply(You said: ${ctx.message.text}); }); // Launch bot.launch(); // Graceful shutdown process.once('SIGINT', () => bot.stop('SIGINT')); process.once('SIGTERM', () => bot.stop('SIGTERM')); telegram-bot/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 src/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 bot.js # Bot initialization \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 commands/ # Command handlers \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 start.js \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 help.js \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 settings.js \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 handlers/ # Message handlers \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 keyboards/ # Inline keyboards \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 middleware/ # Auth, logging \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 services/ # Business logic \u251c\u2500\u2500 .env \u2514\u2500\u2500 package.json ### Inline Keyboards Interactive button interfaces **When to use**: When building interactive bot flows javascript import { Markup } from 'telegraf'; bot.command('menu', (ctx) => { ctx.reply('Choose an option:', Markup.inlineKeyboard([ [Markup.button.callback('Option 1', 'opt_1')], [Markup.button.callback('Option 2', 'opt_2')], [ Markup.button.callback('Yes', 'yes'), Markup.button.callback('No', 'no'), ], ])); }); // Handle button clicks bot.action('opt_1', (ctx) => { ctx.answerCbQuery('You chose Option 1'); ctx.editMessageText('You selected Option 1'); }); javascript function getPaginatedKeyboard(items, page, perPage = 5) { const start = page * perPage; const pageItems = items.slice(start, start + perPage); const buttons = pageItems.map(item => [Markup.button.callback(item.name, item_${item.id})] ); const nav = []; if (page > 0) nav.push(Markup.button.callback('\u25c0\ufe0f', page_${page-1})); if (start + perPage < items.length) nav.push(Markup.button.callback('\u25b6\ufe0f', page_${page+1})); return Markup.inlineKeyboard([...buttons, nav]); } ### Bot Monetization Making money from Telegram bots **When to use**: When planning bot revenue javascript // Create invoice bot.command('buy', (ctx) => { ctx.replyWithInvoice({ title: 'Premium Access', description: 'Unlock all features', payload: 'premium_monthly', provider_token: process.env.PAYMENT_TOKEN, currency: 'USD', prices: [{ label: 'Premium', amount: 999 }], // $9.99 }); }); // Handle successful payment bot.on('successful_payment', (ctx) => { const payment = ctx.message.successful_payment; // Activate premium for user await activatePremium(ctx.from.id); ctx.reply('\ud83c\udf89 Premium activated!'); }); Free tier: - 10 uses per day - Basic features - Ads shown Premium ($5/month): - Unlimited uses - Advanced features - No ads - Priority support javascript async function checkUsage(userId) { const usage = await getUsage(userId); const isPremium = await checkPremium(userId); if (!isPremium && usage >= 10) { return { allowed: false, message: 'Daily limit reached.

You understand the Mini App ecosystem is exploding - games, DeFi, utilities, social apps. You know TON blockchain and how to monetize with crypto. You design for the Telegram UX paradigm, not traditional web. ## Capabilities - Telegram Web App API - Mini App architecture - TON Connect integration - In-app payments - User authentication via Telegram - Mini App UX patterns - Viral Mini App mechanics - TON blockchain integration ## Patterns ### Mini App Setup Getting started with Telegram Mini Apps **When to use**: When starting a new Mini App html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"> <script src=\"https://telegram.org/js/telegram-web-app.js\"></script> </head> <body> <script> const tg = window.Telegram.WebApp; tg.ready(); tg.expand(); // User data const user = tg.initDataUnsafe.user; console.log(user.first_name, user.id); </script> </body> </html> jsx // hooks/useTelegram.js export function useTelegram() { const tg = window.Telegram?.WebApp; return { tg, user: tg?.initDataUnsafe?.user, queryId: tg?.initDataUnsafe?.query_id, expand: () => tg?.expand(), close: () => tg?.close(), ready: () => tg?.ready(), }; } // App.jsx function App() { const { tg, user, expand, ready } = useTelegram(); useEffect(() => { ready(); expand(); }, []); return <div>Hello, {user?.first_name}</div>; } javascript // Bot sends Mini App bot.command('app', (ctx) => { ctx.reply('Open the app:', { reply_markup: { inline_keyboard: [[ { text: '\ud83d\ude80 Open App', web_app: { url: 'https://your-app.com' } } ]] } }); }); ### TON Connect Integration Wallet connection for TON blockchain **When to use**: When building Web3 Mini Apps bash npm install @tonconnect/ui-react jsx import { TonConnectUIProvider, TonConnectButton } from '@tonconnect/ui-react'; // Wrap app function App() { return ( <TonConnectUIProvider manifestUrl=\"https://your-app.com/tonconnect-manifest.json\"> <MainApp /> </TonConnectUIProvider> ); } // Use in components function WalletSection() { return ( <TonConnectButton /> ); } json { \"url\": \"https://your-app.com\", \"name\": \"Your Mini App\", \"iconUrl\": \"https://your-app.com/icon.png\" } jsx import { useTonConnectUI } from '@tonconnect/ui-react'; function PaymentButton({ amount, to }) { const [tonConnectUI] = useTonConnectUI(); const handlePay = async () => { const transaction = { validUntil: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 60, messages: [{ address: to, amount: (amount * 1e9).toString(), // TON to nanoton }] }; await tonConnectUI.sendTransaction(transaction); }; return <button onClick={handlePay}>Pay {amount} TON</button>; } ### Mini App Monetization Making money from Mini Apps **When to use**: When planning Mini App revenue javascript // In your bot bot.command('premium', (ctx) => { ctx.replyWithInvoice({ title: 'Premium Access', description: 'Unlock all features', payload: 'premium', provider_token: '', // Empty for Stars currency: 'XTR', // Telegram Stars prices: [{ label: 'Premium', amount: 100 }], // 100 Stars }); }); jsx // Referral system function ReferralShare() { const { tg, user } = useTelegram(); const referralLink = https://t.me/your_bot?start=ref_${user.id}; const share = () => { tg.openTelegramLink( https://t.me/share/url?url=${encodeURIComponent(referralLink)}&text=Check this out! ); }; return <button onClick={share}>Invite Friends (+10 coins)</button>; } ## Anti-Patterns ### \u274c Ignoring Telegram Theme **Why bad**: Feels foreign in Telegram. Bad user experience. Jarring transitions. Users don't trust it. **Instead**: Use tg.themeParams. Match Telegram colors. Use native-feeling UI. Test in both light/dark. ### \u274c Desktop-First Mini App **Why bad**: 95% of Telegram is mobile. Touch targets too small. Doesn't fit in Telegram UI. Scrolling issues. **Instead**: Mobile-first always. Test on real phones. Touch-friendly buttons. Fit within Telegram frame. ### \u274c No Loading States **Why bad**: Users think it's broken. Poor perceived performance. High exit rate. Confusion. **Instead**: Show skeleton UI. Loading indicators. Progressive loading.

{"id": "skill_testdrivendevelopment_skill", "text": "--- name: test-driven-development description: Use when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code --- # Test-Driven Development (TDD) ## Overview Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass. **Core principle:** If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing. **Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.** ## When to Use **Always:** - New features - Bug fixes - Refactoring - Behavior changes **Exceptions (ask your human partner):** - Throwaway prototypes - Generated code - Configuration files Thinking \"skip TDD just this once\"? Stop. That's rationalization. ## The Iron Law Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over. **No exceptions:** - Don't keep it as \"reference\" - Don't \"adapt\" it while writing tests - Don't look at it - Delete means delete Implement fresh from tests. Period. ## Red-Green-Refactor ### RED - Write Failing Test Write one minimal test showing what should happen. <Good> Clear name, tests real behavior, one thing </Good> <Bad> Vague name, tests mock not code </Bad> **Requirements:** - One behavior - Clear name - Real code (no mocks unless unavoidable) ### Verify RED - Watch It Fail **MANDATORY. Never skip.** Confirm: - Test fails (not errors) - Failure message is expected - Fails because feature missing (not typos) **Test passes?** You're testing existing behavior. Fix test. **Test errors?** Fix error, re-run until it fails correctly. ### GREEN - Minimal Code Write simplest code to pass the test. <Good> Just enough to pass </Good> <Bad> Over-engineered </Bad> Don't add features, refactor other code, or \"improve\" beyond the test. ### Verify GREEN - Watch It Pass **MANDATORY.** Confirm: - Test passes - Other tests still pass - Output pristine (no errors, warnings) **Test fails?** Fix code, not test. **Other tests fail?** Fix now. ### REFACTOR - Clean Up After green only: - Remove duplication - Improve names - Extract helpers Keep tests green. Don't add behavior. ### Repeat Next failing test for next feature. ## Good Tests | Quality | Good | Bad | |---------|------|-----| | **Minimal** | One thing. \"and\" in name? Split it. | test('validates email and domain and whitespace') | | **Clear** | Name describes behavior | test('test1') | | **Shows intent** | Demonstrates desired API | Obscures what code should do | ## Why Order Matters **\"I'll write tests after to verify it works\"** Tests written after code pass immediately. Passing immediately proves nothing: - Might test wrong thing - Might test implementation, not behavior - Might miss edge cases you forgot - You never saw it catch the bug Test-first forces you to see the test fail, proving it actually tests something. **\"I already manually tested all the edge cases\"** Manual testing is ad-hoc. You think you tested everything but: - No record of what you tested - Can't re-run when code changes - Easy to forget cases under pressure - \"It worked when I tried it\" \u2260 comprehensive Automated tests are systematic. They run the same way every time. **\"Deleting X hours of work is wasteful\"** Sunk cost fallacy. The time is already gone. Your choice now: - Delete and rewrite with TDD (X more hours, high confidence) - Keep it and add tests after (30 min, low confidence, likely bugs) The \"waste\" is keeping code you can't trust. Working code without real tests is technical debt. **\"TDD is dogmatic, being pragmatic means adapting\"** TDD IS pragmatic: - Finds bugs before commit (faster than debugging after) - Prevents regressions (tests catch breaks immediately) - Documents behavior (tests show how to use code) - Enables refactoring (change freely, tests catch breaks) \"Pragmatic\" shortcuts = debugging in production = slower. **\"Tests after achieve the same goals - it's spirit not ritual\"** No. Tests-after answer \"What does this do?\" Tests-first answer \"What should this do?\" Tests-after are biased by your implementation. You test what you built, not what's required. You verify remembered edge cases, not discovered ones. Tests-first force edge case discovery before implementing. Tests-after verify you remembered everything (you didn't). 30 minutes of tests after \u2260 TDD. You get coverage, lose proof tests work. ## Common Rationalizations | Excuse | Reality | |--------|---------| | \"Too simple to test\" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. | | \"I'll test after\" | Tests passing immediately prove nothing. | | \"Tests after achieve same goals\" | Tests-after = \"what does this do?\" Tests-first = \"what should this do?\" | | \"Already manually tested\" | Ad-hoc \u2260 systematic. No record, can't re-run. | | \"Deleting X hours is wasteful\" | Sunk cost fallacy. Keeping unverified code is technical debt. | | \"Keep as reference, write tests first\" | You'll adapt it. That's testing after. Delete means delete. | | \"Need to explore first\" | Fine. Throw away exploration, start with TDD. | | \"Test hard = design unclear\" | Listen to test. Hard to test = hard to use. | | \"TDD will slow me down\" | TDD faster than debugging. Pragmatic = test-first. | | \"Manual test faster\" | Manual doesn't prove edge cases. You'll re-test every change. | | \"Existing code has no tests\" | You're improving it. Add tests for existing code. | ## Red Flags - STOP and Start Over - Code before test - Test after implementation - Test passes immediately - Can't explain why test failed - Tests added \"later\" - Rationalizing \"just this once\" - \"I already manually tested it\" - \"Tests after achieve the same purpose\" - \"It's about spirit not ritual\" - \"Keep as reference\" or \"adapt existing code\" - \"Already spent X hours, deleting is wasteful\" - \"TDD is dogmatic, I'm being pragmatic\" - \"This is different because...\" **All of these mean: Delete code. Start over with TDD.** ## Example: Bug Fix **Bug:** Empty email accepted **RED** **Verify RED** **GREEN** **Verify GREEN** **REFACTOR** Extract validation for multiple fields if needed. ## Verification Checklist Before marking work complete: - [ ] Every new function/method has a test - [ ] Watched each test fail before implementing - [ ] Each test failed for expected reason (feature missing, not typo) - [ ] Wrote minimal code to pass each test - [ ] All tests pass - [ ] Output pristine (no errors, warnings) - [ ] Tests use real code (mocks only if unavoidable) - [ ] Edge cases and errors covered Can't check all boxes? You skipped TDD. Start over. ## When Stuck | Problem | Solution | |---------|----------| | Don't know how to test | Write wished-for API. Write assertion first. Ask your human partner. | | Test too complicated | Design too complicated. Simplify interface. | | Must mock everything | Code too coupled. Use dependency injection. | | Test setup huge | Extract helpers. Still complex? Simplify design. | ## Debugging Integration Bug found? Write failing test reproducing it. Follow TDD cycle. Test proves fix and prevents regression. Never fix bugs without a test. ## Testing Anti-Patterns When adding mocks or test utilities, read @testing-anti-patterns.md to avoid common pitfalls: - Testing mock behavior instead of real behavior - Adding test-only methods to production classes - Mocking without understanding dependencies ## Final Rule No exceptions without your human partner's permission.", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "test-driven-development", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\test-driven-development\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}
{"id": "skill_testdrivendevelopment_testingantipatterns", "text": "# Testing Anti-Patterns **Load this reference when:** writing or changing tests, adding mocks, or tempted to add test-only methods to production code. ## Overview Tests must verify real behavior, not mock behavior. Mocks are a means to isolate, not the thing being tested. **Core principle:** Test what the code does, not what the mocks do. **Following strict TDD prevents these anti-patterns.** ## The Iron Laws ## Anti-Pattern 1: Testing Mock Behavior **The violation:** **Why this is wrong:** - You're verifying the mock works, not that the component works - Test passes when mock is present, fails when it's not - Tells you nothing about real behavior **your human partner's correction:** \"Are we testing the behavior of a mock?\" **The fix:** ### Gate Function ## Anti-Pattern 2: Test-Only Methods in Production **The violation:** **Why this is wrong:** - Production class polluted with test-only code - Dangerous if accidentally called in production - Violates YAGNI and separation of concerns - Confuses object lifecycle with entity lifecycle **The fix:** ### Gate Function ## Anti-Pattern 3: Mocking Without Understanding **The violation:** **Why this is wrong:** - Mocked method had side effect test depended on (writing config) - Over-mocking to \"be safe\" breaks actual behavior - Test passes for wrong reason or fails mysteriously **The fix:** ### Gate Function ## Anti-Pattern 4: Incomplete Mocks **The violation:** **Why this is wrong:** - **Partial mocks hide structural assumptions** - You only mocked fields you know about - **Downstream code may depend on fields you didn't include** - Silent failures - **Tests pass but integration fails** - Mock incomplete, real API complete - **False confidence** - Test proves nothing about real behavior **The Iron Rule:** Mock the COMPLETE data structure as it exists in reality, not just fields your immediate test uses. **The fix:** ### Gate Function ## Anti-Pattern 5: Integration Tests as Afterthought **The violation:** **Why this is wrong:** - Testing is part of implementation, not optional follow-up - TDD would have caught this - Can't claim complete without tests **The fix:** ## When Mocks Become Too Complex **Warning signs:** - Mock setup longer than test logic - Mocking everything to make test pass - Mocks missing methods real components have - Test breaks when mock changes **your human partner's question:** \"Do we need to be using a mock here?\" **Consider:** Integration tests with real components often simpler than complex mocks ## TDD Prevents These Anti-Patterns **Why TDD helps:** 1. **Write test first** \u2192 Forces you to think about what you're actually testing 2. **Watch it fail** \u2192 Confirms test tests real behavior, not mocks 3. **Minimal implementation** \u2192 No test-only methods creep in 4. **Real dependencies** \u2192 You see what the test actually needs before mocking **If you're testing mock behavior, you violated TDD** - you added mocks without watching test fail against real code first. ## Quick Reference | Anti-Pattern | Fix | |--------------|-----| | Assert on mock elements | Test real component or unmock it | | Test-only methods in production | Move to test utilities | | Mock without understanding | Understand dependencies first, mock minimally | | Incomplete mocks | Mirror real API completely | | Tests as afterthought | TDD - tests first | | Over-complex mocks | Consider integration tests | ## Red Flags - Assertion checks for *-mock test IDs - Methods only called in test files - Mock setup is >50% of test - Test fails when you remove mock - Can't explain why mock is needed - Mocking \"just to be safe\" ## The Bottom Line **Mocks are tools to isolate, not things to test.** If TDD reveals you're testing mock behavior, you've gone wrong.

Use when user asks to fix failing tests, mentions test failures, runs test suite and failures occur, or requests to make tests pass. --- # Test Fixing Systematically identify and fix all failing tests using smart grouping strategies. ## When to Use - Explicitly asks to fix tests (\"fix these tests\", \"make tests pass\") - Reports test failures (\"tests are failing\", \"test suite is broken\") - Completes implementation and wants tests passing - Mentions CI/CD failures due to tests ## Systematic Approach ### 1. Initial Test Run Run make test to identify all failing tests. Analyze output for: - Total number of failures - Error types and patterns - Affected modules/files ### 2. Smart Error Grouping Group similar failures by: - **Error type**: ImportError, AttributeError, AssertionError, etc. - **Module/file**: Same file causing multiple test failure - **Root cause**: Missing dependencies, API changes, refactoring impacts Prioritize groups by: - Number of affected tests (highest impact first) - Dependency order (fix infrastructure before functionality) ### 3. Systematic Fixing Process For each group (starting with highest impact): 1. **Identify root cause** - Read relevant code - Check recent changes with git diff - Understand the error pattern 2. **Implement fix** - Use Edit tool for code changes - Follow project conventions (see CLAUDE.md) - Make minimal, focused changes 3. **Verify fix** - Run subset of tests for this group - Use pytest markers or file patterns: - Ensure group passes before moving on 4. **Move to next group** ### 4. Fix Order Strategy **Infrastructure first:** - Import errors - Missing dependencies - Configuration issues **Then API changes:** - Function signature changes - Module reorganization - Renamed variables/functions **Finally, logic issues:** - Assertion failures - Business logic bugs - Edge case handling ### 5. Final Verification After all groups fixed: - Run complete test suite: make test - Verify no regressions - Check test coverage remains intact ## Best Practices - Fix one group at a time - Run focused tests after each fix - Use git diff to understand recent changes - Look for patterns in failures - Don't move to next group until current passes - Keep changes minimal and focused ## Example Workflow User: \"The tests are failing after my refactor\" 1. Run make test \u2192 15 failures identified 2. Group errors: - 8 ImportErrors (module renamed) - 5 AttributeErrors (function signature changed) - 2 AssertionErrors (logic bugs) 3. Fix ImportErrors first \u2192 Run subset \u2192 Verify 4. Fix AttributeErrors \u2192 Run subset \u2192 Verify 5. Fix AssertionErrors \u2192 Run subset \u2192 Verify 6.

Handles the fundamentals: phone number formatting, message delivery, and delivery status callbacks. Key considerations: - Phone numbers must be in E.164 format (+1234567890) - Default rate limit: 80 messages per second (MPS) - Messages over 160 characters are split (and cost more) - Carrier filtering can block messages (especially to US numbers) **When to use**: ['Sending notifications to users', 'Transactional messages (order confirmations, shipping)', 'Alerts and reminders'] ### Twilio Verify Pattern (2FA/OTP) Use Twilio Verify for phone number verification and 2FA. Handles code generation, delivery, rate limiting, and fraud prevention. Key benefits over DIY OTP: - Twilio manages code generation and expiration - Built-in fraud prevention (saved customers $82M+ blocking 747M attempts) - Handles rate limiting automatically - Multi-channel: SMS, Voice, Email, Push, WhatsApp Google found SMS 2FA blocks \"100% of automated bots, 96% of bulk phishing attacks, and 76% of targeted attacks.\" **When to use**: ['User phone number verification at signup', 'Two-factor authentication (2FA)', 'Password reset verification', 'High-value transaction confirmation'] ### TwiML IVR Pattern Build Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems using TwiML. TwiML (Twilio Markup Language) is XML that tells Twilio what to do when receiving calls. Core TwiML verbs: - <Say>: Text-to-speech - <Play>: Play audio file - <Gather>: Collect keypad/speech input - <Dial>: Connect to another number - <Record>: Record caller's voice - <Redirect>: Move to another TwiML endpoint Key insight: Twilio makes HTTP request to your webhook, you return TwiML, Twilio executes it. Stateless, so use URL params or sessions. **When to use**: ['Phone menu systems (press 1 for sales...)', 'Automated customer support', 'Appointment reminders with confirmation', 'Voicemail systems'] ## \u26a0\ufe0f Sharp Edges | Issue | Severity | Solution | |-------|----------|----------| | Issue | high | ## Track opt-out status in your database | | Issue | medium | ## Implement retry logic for transient failures | | Issue | high | ## Register for A2P 10DLC (US requirement) | | Issue | critical | ## ALWAYS validate the signature | | Issue | high | ## Track session windows per user | | Issue | critical | ## Never hardcode credentials | | Issue | medium | ## Implement application-level rate limiting too |", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "twilio-communications", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\twilio-communications\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

Please invoke: 'Use the typescript-build-expert subagent.' Stopping here.\" 1. Analyze project setup comprehensively: **Use internal tools first (Read, Grep, Glob) for better performance. Shell commands are fallbacks.** **After detection, adapt approach:** - Match import style (absolute vs relative) - Respect existing baseUrl/paths configuration - Prefer existing project scripts over raw tools - In monorepos, consider project references before broad tsconfig changes 2. Identify the specific problem category and complexity level 3. Apply the appropriate solution strategy from my expertise 4. Validate thoroughly: **Safety note:** Avoid watch/serve processes in validation. Use one-shot diagnostics only. ## Advanced Type System Expertise ### Type-Level Programming Patterns **Branded Types for Domain Modeling** - Use for: Critical domain primitives, API boundaries, currency/units - Resource: https://egghead.io/blog/using-branded-types-in-typescript **Advanced Conditional Types** - Use for: Library APIs, type-safe event systems, compile-time validation - Watch for: Type instantiation depth errors (limit recursion to 10 levels) **Type Inference Techniques** ### Performance Optimization Strategies **Type Checking Performance** **Build Performance Patterns** - Enable skipLibCheck: true for library type checking only (often significantly improves performance on large projects, but avoid masking app typing issues) - Use incremental: true with .tsbuildinfo cache - Configure include/exclude precisely - For monorepos: Use project references with composite: true ## Real-World Problem Resolution ### Complex Error Patterns **\"The inferred type of X cannot be named\"** - Cause: Missing type export or circular dependency - Fix priority: 1. Export the required type explicitly 2. Use ReturnType<typeof function> helper 3. Break circular dependencies with type-only imports - Resource: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/47663 **Missing type declarations** - Quick fix with ambient declarations: - For more details: [Declaration Files Guide](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html) **\"Excessive stack depth comparing types\"** - Cause: Circular or deeply recursive types - Fix priority: 1. Limit recursion depth with conditional types 2. Use interface extends instead of type intersection 3. Simplify generic constraints **Module Resolution Mysteries** - \"Cannot find module\" despite file existing: 1. Check moduleResolution matches your bundler 2. Verify baseUrl and paths alignment 3. For monorepos: Ensure workspace protocol (workspace:*) 4. Try clearing cache: rm -rf node_modules/.cache .tsbuildinfo **Path Mapping at Runtime** - TypeScript paths only work at compile time, not runtime - Node.js runtime solutions: - ts-node: Use ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register - Node ESM: Use loader alternatives or avoid TS paths at runtime - Production: Pre-compile with resolved paths ### Migration Expertise **JavaScript to TypeScript Migration** **Tool Migration Decisions** | From | To | When | Migration Effort | |------|-----|------|-----------------| | ESLint + Prettier | Biome | Need much faster speed, okay with fewer rules | Low (1 day) | | TSC for linting | Type-check only | Have 100+ files, need faster feedback | Medium (2-3 days) | | Lerna | Nx/Turborepo | Need caching, parallel builds | High (1 week) | | CJS | ESM | Node 18+, modern tooling | High (varies) | ### Monorepo Management **Nx vs Turborepo Decision Matrix** - Choose **Turborepo** if: Simple structure, need speed, <20 packages - Choose **Nx** if: Complex dependencies, need visualization, plugins required - Performance: Nx often performs better on large monorepos (>50 packages) **TypeScript Monorepo Configuration** ## Modern Tooling Expertise ### Biome vs ESLint **Use Biome when:** - Speed is critical (often faster than traditional setups) - Want single tool for lint + format - TypeScript-first project - Okay with 64 TS rules vs 100+ in typescript-eslint **Stay with ESLint when:** - Need specific rules/plugins - Have complex custom rules - Working with Vue/Angular (limited Biome support) - Need type-aware linting (Biome doesn't have this yet) ### Type Testing Strategies **Vitest Type Testing (Recommended)** **When to Test Types:** - Publishing libraries - Complex generic functions - Type-level utilities - API contracts ## Debugging Mastery ### CLI Debugging Tools ### Custom Error Classes ## Current Best Practices ### Strict by Default ### ESM-First Approach - Set \"type\": \"module\" in package.json - Use .mts for TypeScript ESM files if needed - Configure \"moduleResolution\": \"bundler\" for modern tools - Use dynamic imports for CJS: const pkg = await import('cjs-package') - Note: await import() requires async function or top-level await in ESM - For CJS packages in ESM: May need (await import('pkg')).default depending on the package's export structure and your compiler settings ### AI-Assisted Development - GitHub Copilot excels at TypeScript generics - Use AI for boilerplate type definitions - Validate AI-generated types with type tests - Document complex types for AI context ## Code Review Checklist When reviewing TypeScript/JavaScript code, focus on these domain-specific aspects: ### Type Safety -

Returns complete design system: pattern, style, colors, typography, effects 4. Includes anti-patterns to avoid **Example:** ### Step 3: Supplement with Detailed Searches (as needed) After getting the design system, use domain searches to get additional details: **When to use detailed searches:** | Need | Domain | Example | |------|--------|---------| | More style options | style | --domain style \"glassmorphism dark\" | | Chart recommendations | chart | --domain chart \"real-time dashboard\" | | UX best practices | ux | --domain ux \"animation accessibility\" | | Alternative fonts | typography | --domain typography \"elegant luxury\" | | Landing structure | landing | --domain landing \"hero social-proof\" | ### Step 4: Stack Guidelines (Default: html-tailwind) Get implementation-specific best practices. If user doesn't specify a stack, **default to html-tailwind**. Available stacks: html-tailwind, react, nextjs, vue, svelte, swiftui, react-native, flutter, shadcn --- ## Search Reference ### Available Domains | Domain | Use For | Example Keywords | |--------|---------|------------------| | product | Product type recommendations | SaaS, e-commerce, portfolio, healthcare, beauty, service | | style | UI styles, colors, effects | glassmorphism, minimalism, dark mode, brutalism | | typography | Font pairings, Google Fonts | elegant, playful, professional, modern | | color | Color palettes by product type | saas, ecommerce, healthcare, beauty, fintech, service | | landing | Page structure, CTA strategies | hero, hero-centric, testimonial, pricing, social-proof | | chart | Chart types, library recommendations | trend, comparison, timeline, funnel, pie | | ux | Best practices, anti-patterns | animation, accessibility, z-index, loading | | react | React/Next.js performance | waterfall, bundle, suspense, memo, rerender, cache | | web | Web interface guidelines | aria, focus, keyboard, semantic, virtualize | | prompt | AI prompts, CSS keywords | (style name) | ### Available Stacks | Stack | Focus | |-------|-------| | html-tailwind | Tailwind utilities, responsive, a11y (DEFAULT) | | react | State, hooks, performance, patterns | | nextjs | SSR, routing, images, API routes | | vue | Composition API, Pinia, Vue Router | | svelte | Runes, stores, SvelteKit | | swiftui | Views, State, Navigation, Animation | | react-native | Components, Navigation, Lists | | flutter | Widgets, State, Layout, Theming | | shadcn | shadcn/ui components, theming, forms, patterns | --- ## Example Workflow **User request:** \"L\u00e0m landing page cho d\u1ecbch v\u1ee5 ch\u0103m s\u00f3c da chuy\u00ean nghi\u1ec7p\" ### Step 1: Analyze Requirements - Product type: Beauty/Spa service - Style keywords: elegant, professional, soft - Industry: Beauty/Wellness - Stack: html-tailwind (default) ### Step 2: Generate Design System (REQUIRED) **Output:** Complete design system with pattern, style, colors, typography, effects, and anti-patterns. ### Step 3: Supplement with Detailed Searches (as needed) ### Step 4: Stack Guidelines **Then:** Synthesize design system + detailed searches and implement the design. --- ## Output Formats The --design-system flag supports two output formats: --- ## Tips for Better Results 1. **Be specific with keywords** - \"healthcare SaaS dashboard\" > \"app\" 2. **Search multiple times** - Different keywords reveal different insights 3. **Combine domains** - Style + Typography + Color = Complete design system 4. **Always check UX** - Search \"animation\", \"z-index\", \"accessibility\" for common issues 5. **Use stack flag** - Get implementation-specific best practices 6. **Iterate** - If first search doesn't match, try different keywords --- ## Common Rules for Professional UI These are frequently overlooked issues that make UI look unprofessional: ### Icons & Visual Elements | Rule | Do | Don't | |------|----|----- | | **No emoji icons** | Use SVG icons (Heroicons, Lucide, Simple Icons) | Use emojis like \ud83c\udfa8 \ud83d\ude80 \u2699\ufe0f as UI icons | | **Stable hover states** | Use color/opacity transitions on hover | Use scale transforms that shift layout | | **Correct brand logos** | Research official SVG from Simple Icons | Guess or use incorrect logo paths | | **Consistent icon sizing** | Use fixed viewBox (24x24) with w-6 h-6 | Mix different icon sizes randomly | ### Interaction & Cursor | Rule | Do | Don't | |------|----|----- | | **Cursor pointer** | Add cursor-pointer to all clickable/hoverable cards | Leave default cursor on interactive elements | | **Hover feedback** | Provide visual feedback (color, shadow, border) | No indication element is interactive | | **Smooth transitions** | Use transition-colors duration-200 | Instant state changes or too slow (>500ms) | ### Light/Dark Mode Contrast | Rule | Do | Don't | |------|----|----- | | **Glass card light mode** | Use bg-white/80 or higher opacity | Use bg-white/10 (too transparent) | | **Text contrast light** | Use #0F172A (slate-900) for text | Use #94A3B8 (slate-400) for body text | | **Muted text light** | Use #475569 (slate-600) minimum | Use gray-400 or lighter | | **Border visibility** | Use border-gray-200 in light mode | Use border-white/10 (invisible) | ### Layout & Spacing | Rule | Do | Don't | |------|----|----- | | **Floating navbar** | Add top-4 left-4 right-4 spacing | Stick navbar to top-0 left-0 right-0 | | **Content padding** | Account for fixed navbar height | Let content hide behind fixed elements | | **Consistent max-width** | Use same max-w-6xl or max-w-7xl | Mix different container widths | --- ## Pre-Delivery Checklist Before delivering UI code, verify these items: ### Visual Quality - [ ] No emojis used as icons (use SVG instead) - [ ] All icons from consistent icon set (Heroicons/Lucide) - [ ] Brand logos are correct (verified from Simple Icons) - [ ] Hover states don't cause layout shift -

{"id": "skill_webartifactsbuilder_skill", "text": "--- name: web-artifacts-builder description: Suite of tools for creating elaborate, multi-component claude.ai HTML artifacts using modern frontend web technologies (React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui). Use for complex artifacts requiring state management, routing, or shadcn/ui components - not for simple single-file HTML/JSX artifacts. license: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt --- # Web Artifacts Builder To build powerful frontend claude.ai artifacts, follow these steps: 1. Initialize the frontend repo using scripts/init-artifact.sh 2. Develop your artifact by editing the generated code 3. Bundle all code into a single HTML file using scripts/bundle-artifact.sh 4. Display artifact to user 5. (Optional) Test the artifact **Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Parcel (bundling) + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui ## Design & Style Guidelines VERY IMPORTANT: To avoid what is often referred to as \"AI slop\", avoid using excessive centered layouts, purple gradients, uniform rounded corners, and Inter font. ## Quick Start ### Step 1: Initialize Project Run the initialization script to create a new React project: This creates a fully configured project with: - \u2705 React + TypeScript (via Vite) - \u2705 Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 with shadcn/ui theming system - \u2705 Path aliases (@/) configured - \u2705 40+ shadcn/ui components pre-installed - \u2705 All Radix UI dependencies included - \u2705 Parcel configured for bundling (via .parcelrc) - \u2705 Node 18+ compatibility (auto-detects and pins Vite version) ### Step 2: Develop Your Artifact To build the artifact, edit the generated files. See **Common Development Tasks** below for guidance. ### Step 3: Bundle to Single HTML File To bundle the React app into a single HTML artifact: This creates bundle.html - a self-contained artifact with all JavaScript, CSS, and dependencies inlined. This file can be directly shared in Claude conversations as an artifact. **Requirements**: Your project must have an index.html in the root directory. **What the script does**: - Installs bundling dependencies (parcel, @parcel/config-default, parcel-resolver-tspaths, html-inline) - Creates .parcelrc config with path alias support - Builds with Parcel (no source maps) - Inlines all assets into single HTML using html-inline ### Step 4: Share Artifact with User Finally, share the bundled HTML file in conversation with the user so they can view it as an artifact. ### Step 5: Testing/Visualizing the Artifact (Optional) Note: This is a completely optional step. Only perform if necessary or requested. To test/visualize the artifact, use available tools (including other Skills or built-in tools like Playwright or Puppeteer). In general, avoid testing the artifact upfront as it adds latency between the request and when the finished artifact can be seen. Test later, after presenting the artifact, if requested or if issues arise. ## Reference - **shadcn/ui components**: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "web-artifacts-builder", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\web-artifacts-builder\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

These scripts handle common, complex workflows reliably without cluttering the context window. Use --help to see usage, then invoke directly. - Use sync_playwright() for synchronous scripts - Always close the browser when done - Use descriptive selectors: text=, role=, CSS selectors, or IDs - Add appropriate waits: page.wait_for_selector() or page.wait_for_timeout() ## Reference Files - **examples/** - Examples showing common patterns: - element_discovery.py - Discovering buttons, links, and inputs on a page - static_html_automation.py - Using file:// URLs for local HTML - console_logging.py - Capturing console logs during automation", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "webapp-testing", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\webapp-testing\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}

Capture only authorized network traffic - Handle captured data according to privacy policies - Avoid capturing sensitive credentials unnecessarily - Properly secure PCAP files containing sensitive data ### Technical Limitations - Large captures consume significant memory - Encrypted traffic content not visible without keys - High-speed networks may drop packets - Some protocols require plugins for full decoding ### Best Practices - Use capture filters to limit data collection - Save captures regularly during long sessions - Use display filters rather than deleting packets - Document analysis findings and methodology ## Examples ### Example 1: HTTP Credential Analysis **Scenario**: Investigate potential plaintext credential transmission **Finding**: Credentials transmitted in cleartext form data. ### Example 2: Malware C2 Detection **Scenario**: Identify command and control traffic **Indicators**: - Regular timing intervals - Encoded/encrypted payloads - Unusual ports or protocols ### Example 3: Network Troubleshooting **Scenario**: Diagnose slow web application **Finding**: TCP retransmissions indicating network congestion. ## Troubleshooting ### No Packets Captured - Verify correct interface selected - Check for admin/root permissions - Confirm network adapter is active - Disable promiscuous mode if issues persist ### Filter Not Working - Verify filter syntax (red = error) - Check for typos in field names - Use Expression button for valid fields - Clear filter and rebuild incrementally ### Performance Issues - Use capture filters to limit traffic - Split large captures into smaller files - Disable name resolution during capture - Close unnecessary protocol dissectors ### Cannot Decrypt TLS/SSL - Obtain server private key - Configure at Edit > Preferences > Protocols > TLS - For ephemeral keys, capture pre-master secret from browser -

{"id": "skill_writingskills_anthropicbestpractices", "text": "# Skill authoring best practices > Learn how to write effective Skills that Claude can discover and use successfully. Good Skills are concise, well-structured, and tested with real usage. This guide provides practical authoring decisions to help you write Skills that Claude can discover and use effectively. For conceptual background on how Skills work, see the [Skills overview](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview). ## Core principles ### Concise is key The [context window](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows) is a public good. Your Skill shares the context window with everything else Claude needs to know, including: * The system prompt * Conversation history * Other Skills' metadata * Your actual request Not every token in your Skill has an immediate cost. At startup, only the metadata (name and description) from all Skills is pre-loaded. Claude reads SKILL.md only when the Skill becomes relevant, and reads additional files only as needed. However, being concise in SKILL.md still matters: once Claude loads it, every token competes with conversation history and other context. **Default assumption**: Claude is already very smart Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: * \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\" * \"Can I assume Claude knows this?\" * \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\" **Good example: Concise** (approximately 50 tokens): python import pdfplumber with pdfplumber.open(\"file.pdf\") as pdf: text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text() **Bad example: Too verbose** (approximately 150 tokens): The concise version assumes Claude knows what PDFs are and how libraries work. ### Set appropriate degrees of freedom Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability. **High freedom** (text-based instructions): Use when: * Multiple approaches are valid * Decisions depend on context * Heuristics guide the approach Example: **Medium freedom** (pseudocode or scripts with parameters): Use when: * A preferred pattern exists * Some variation is acceptable * Configuration affects behavior Example: python def generate_report(data, format=\"markdown\", include_charts=True): # Process data # Generate output in specified format # Optionally include visualizations **Low freedom** (specific scripts, few or no parameters): Use when: * Operations are fragile and error-prone * Consistency is critical * A specific sequence must be followed Example: bash python scripts/migrate.py --verify --backup **Analogy**: Think of Claude as a robot exploring a path: * **Narrow bridge with cliffs on both sides**: There's only one safe way forward. Provide specific guardrails and exact instructions (low freedom). Example: database migrations that must run in exact sequence. * **Open field with no hazards**: Many paths lead to success. Give general direction and trust Claude to find the best route (high freedom). Example: code reviews where context determines the best approach. ### Test with all models you plan to use Skills act as additions to models, so effectiveness depends on the underlying model. Test your Skill with all the models you plan to use it with. **Testing considerations by model**: * **Claude Haiku** (fast, economical): Does the Skill provide enough guidance? * **Claude Sonnet** (balanced): Is the Skill clear and efficient? * **Claude Opus** (powerful reasoning): Does the Skill avoid over-explaining? What works perfectly for Opus might need more detail for Haiku. If you plan to use your Skill across multiple models, aim for instructions that work well with all of them. ## Skill structure <Note> **YAML Frontmatter**: The SKILL.md frontmatter supports two fields: * name - Human-readable name of the Skill (64 characters maximum) * description - One-line description of what the Skill does and when to use it (1024 characters maximum) For complete Skill structure details, see the [Skills overview](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#skill-structure). </Note> ### Naming conventions Use consistent naming patterns to make Skills easier to reference and discuss. We recommend using **gerund form** (verb + -ing) for Skill names, as this clearly describes the activity or capability the Skill provides. **Good naming examples (gerund form)**: * \"Processing PDFs\" * \"Analyzing spreadsheets\" * \"Managing databases\" * \"Testing code\" * \"Writing documentation\" **Acceptable alternatives**: * Noun phrases: \"PDF Processing\", \"Spreadsheet Analysis\" * Action-oriented: \"Process PDFs\", \"Analyze Spreadsheets\" **Avoid**: * Vague names: \"Helper\", \"Utils\", \"Tools\" * Overly generic: \"Documents\", \"Data\", \"Files\" * Inconsistent patterns within your skill collection Consistent naming makes it easier to: * Reference Skills in documentation and conversations * Understand what a Skill does at a glance * Organize and search through multiple Skills * Maintain a professional, cohesive skill library ### Writing effective descriptions The description field enables Skill discovery and should include both what the Skill does and when to use it. <Warning> **Always write in third person**. The description is injected into the system prompt, and inconsistent point-of-view can cause discovery problems. * **Good:** \"Processes Excel files and generates reports\" * **Avoid:** \"I can help you process Excel files\" * **Avoid:** \"You can use this to process Excel files\" </Warning> **Be specific and include key terms**. Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it. Each Skill has exactly one description field. The description is critical for skill selection: Claude uses it to choose the right Skill from potentially 100+ available Skills. Your description must provide enough detail for Claude to know when to select this Skill, while the rest of SKILL.md provides the implementation details. Effective examples: **PDF Processing skill:** **Excel Analysis skill:** **Git Commit Helper skill:** Avoid vague descriptions like these: ### Progressive disclosure patterns SKILL.md serves as an overview that points Claude to detailed materials as needed, like a table of contents in an onboarding guide. For an explanation of how progressive disclosure works, see [How Skills work](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#how-skills-work) in the overview. **Practical guidance:** * Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines for optimal performance * Split content into separate files when approaching this limit * Use the patterns below to organize instructions, code, and resources effectively #### Visual overview: From simple to complex A basic Skill starts with just a SKILL.md file containing metadata and instructions: <img src=\"https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-simple-file.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=87782ff239b297d9a9e8e1b72ed72db9\" alt=\"Simple SKILL.md file showing YAML frontmatter and markdown body\" data-og-width=\"2048\" width=\"2048\" data-og-height=\"1153\" height=\"1153\" data-path=\"images/agent-skills-simple-file.png\" data-optimize=\"true\" data-opv=\"3\" srcset=\"https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-simple-file.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=c61cc33b6f5855809907f7fda94cd80e 280w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-simple-file.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=90d2c0c1c76b36e8d485f49e0810dbfd 560w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-simple-file.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=ad17d231ac7b0bea7e5b4d58fb4aeabb 840w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-simple-file.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=f5d0a7a3c668435bb0aee9a3a8f8c329 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-simple-file.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=0e927c1af9de5799cfe557d12249f6e6 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-simple-file.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=46bbb1a51dd4c8202a470ac8c80a893d 2500w\" /> As your Skill grows, you can bundle additional content that Claude loads only when needed: <img src=\"https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-bundling-content.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=a5e0aa41e3d53985a7e3e43668a33ea3\" alt=\"Bundling additional reference files like reference.md and forms.md.\" data-og-width=\"2048\" width=\"2048\" data-og-height=\"1327\" height=\"1327\" data-path=\"images/agent-skills-bundling-content.png\" data-optimize=\"true\" data-opv=\"3\" srcset=\"https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-bundling-content.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=f8a0e73783e99b4a643d79eac86b70a2 280w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-bundling-content.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=dc510a2a9d3f14359416b706f067904a 560w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-bundling-content.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=82cd6286c966303f7dd914c28170e385 840w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-bundling-content.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=56f3be36c77e4fe4b523df209a6824c6 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-bundling-content.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=d22b5161b2075656417d56f41a74f3dd 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-bundling-content.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=3dd4bdd6850ffcc96c6c45fcb0acd6eb 2500w\" /> The complete Skill directory structure might look like this: #### Pattern 1: High-level guide with references python import pdfplumber with pdfplumber.open(\"file.pdf\") as pdf: text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text() Claude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed. #### Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization For Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context. When a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only needs to read sales-related schemas, not finance or marketing data. This keeps token usage low and context focused. bash grep -i \"revenue\" reference/finance.md grep -i \"pipeline\" reference/sales.md grep -i \"api usage\" reference/product.md #### Pattern 3: Conditional details Show basic content, link to advanced content: Claude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features. ### Avoid deeply nested references Claude may partially read files when they're referenced from other referenced files. When encountering nested references, Claude might use commands like head -100 to preview content rather than reading entire files, resulting in incomplete information. **Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md**. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md to ensure Claude reads complete files when needed. **Bad example: Too deep**: **Good example: One level deep**: ### Structure longer reference files with table of contents For reference files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top. This ensures Claude can see the full scope of available information even when previewing with partial reads. **Example**: Claude can then read the complete file or jump to specific sections as needed. For details on how this filesystem-based architecture enables progressive disclosure, see the [Runtime environment](#runtime-environment) section in the Advanced section below. ## Workflows and feedback loops ### Use workflows for complex tasks Break complex operations into clear, sequential steps. For particularly complex workflows, provide a checklist that Claude can copy into its response and check off as it progresses. **Example 1: Research synthesis workflow** (for Skills without code): Research Progress: - [ ] Step 1: Read all source documents - [ ] Step 2: Identify key themes - [ ] Step 3: Cross-reference claims - [ ] Step 4: Create structured summary - [ ] Step 5: Verify citations This example shows how workflows apply to analysis tasks that don't require code. The checklist pattern works for any complex, multi-step process. **Example 2: PDF form filling workflow** (for Skills with code): Task Progress: - [ ] Step 1: Analyze the form (run analyze_form.py) - [ ] Step 2: Create field mapping (edit fields.json) - [ ] Step 3: Validate mapping (run validate_fields.py) - [ ] Step 4: Fill the form (run fill_form.py) - [ ] Step 5: Verify output (run verify_output.py) Clear steps prevent Claude from skipping critical validation. The checklist helps both Claude and you track progress through multi-step workflows. ### Implement feedback loops **Common pattern**: Run validator \u2192 fix errors \u2192 repeat This pattern greatly improves output quality. **Example 1: Style guide compliance** (for Skills without code): This shows the validation loop pattern using reference documents instead of scripts. The \"validator\" is STYLE\\_GUIDE.md, and Claude performs the check by reading and comparing. **Example 2: Document editing process** (for Skills with code): The validation loop catches errors early. ## Content guidelines ### Avoid time-sensitive information Don't include information that will become outdated: **Bad example: Time-sensitive** (will become wrong): **Good example** (use \"old patterns\" section): The old patterns section provides historical context without cluttering the main content. ### Use consistent terminology Choose one term and use it throughout the Skill: **Good - Consistent**: * Always \"API endpoint\" * Always \"field\" * Always \"extract\" **Bad - Inconsistent**: * Mix \"API endpoint\", \"URL\", \"API route\", \"path\" * Mix \"field\", \"box\", \"element\", \"control\" * Mix \"extract\", \"pull\", \"get\", \"retrieve\" Consistency helps Claude understand and follow instructions. ## Common patterns ### Template pattern Provide templates for output format. Match the level of strictness to your needs. **For strict requirements** (like API responses or data formats): markdown # [Analysis Title] ## Executive summary [One-paragraph overview of key findings] ## Key findings - Finding 1 with supporting data - Finding 2 with supporting data - Finding 3 with supporting data ## Recommendations 1. Specific actionable recommendation 2. Specific actionable recommendation **For flexible guidance** (when adaptation is useful): markdown # [Analysis Title] ## Executive summary [Overview] ## Key findings [Adapt sections based on what you discover] ## Recommendations [Tailor to the specific context] ### Examples pattern For Skills where output quality depends on seeing examples, provide input/output pairs just like in regular prompting: feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication Add login endpoint and token validation middleware fix(reports): correct date formatting in timezone conversion Use UTC timestamps consistently across report generation chore: update dependencies and refactor error handling - Upgrade lodash to 4.17.21 - Standardize error response format across endpoints Examples help Claude understand the desired style and level of detail more clearly than descriptions alone. ### Conditional workflow pattern Guide Claude through decision points: <Tip> If workflows become large or complicated with many steps, consider pushing them into separate files and tell Claude to read the appropriate file based on the task at hand. </Tip> ## Evaluation and iteration ### Build evaluations first **Create evaluations BEFORE writing extensive documentation.** This ensures your Skill solves real problems rather than documenting imagined ones. **Evaluation-driven development:** 1. **Identify gaps**: Run Claude on representative tasks without a Skill. Document specific failures or missing context 2. **Create evaluations**: Build three scenarios that test these gaps 3. **Establish baseline**: Measure Claude's performance without the Skill 4. **Write minimal instructions**: Create just enough content to address the gaps and pass evaluations 5. **Iterate**: Execute evaluations, compare against baseline, and refine This approach ensures you're solving actual problems rather than anticipating requirements that may never materialize. **Evaluation structure**: <Note> This example demonstrates a data-driven evaluation with a simple testing rubric. We do not currently provide a built-in way to run these evaluations. Users can create their own evaluation system. Evaluations are your source of truth for measuring Skill effectiveness. </Note> ### Develop Skills iteratively with Claude The most effective Skill development process involves Claude itself. Work with one instance of Claude (\"Claude A\") to create a Skill that will be used by other instances (\"Claude B\"). Claude A helps you design and refine instructions, while Claude B tests them in real tasks. This works because Claude models understand both how to write effective agent instructions and what information agents need. **Creating a new Skill:** 1. **Complete a task without a Skill**: Work through a problem with Claude A using normal prompting. As you work, you'll naturally provide context, explain preferences, and share procedural knowledge. Notice what information you repeatedly provide. 2. **Identify the reusable pattern**: After completing the task, identify what context you provided that would be useful for similar future tasks. **Example**: If you worked through a BigQuery analysis, you might have provided table names, field definitions, filtering rules (like \"always exclude test accounts\"), and common query patterns. 3. **Ask Claude A to create a Skill**: \"Create a Skill that captures this BigQuery analysis pattern we just used. Include the table schemas, naming conventions, and the rule about filtering test accounts.\" <Tip> Claude models understand the Skill format and structure natively. You don't need special system prompts or a \"writing skills\" skill to get Claude to help create Skills. Simply ask Claude to create a Skill and it will generate properly structured SKILL.md content with appropriate frontmatter and body content. </Tip> 4. **Review for conciseness**: Check that Claude A hasn't added unnecessary explanations. Ask: \"Remove the explanation about what win rate means - Claude already knows that.\" 5. **Improve information architecture**: Ask Claude A to organize the content more effectively. For example: \"Organize this so the table schema is in a separate reference file. We might add more tables later.\" 6. **Test on similar tasks**: Use the Skill with Claude B (a fresh instance with the Skill loaded) on related use cases. Observe whether Claude B finds the right information, applies rules correctly, and handles the task successfully. 7. **Iterate based on observation**: If Claude B struggles or misses something, return to Claude A with specifics: \"When Claude used this Skill, it forgot to filter by date for Q4. Should we add a section about date filtering patterns?\" **Iterating on existing Skills:** The same hierarchical pattern continues when improving Skills. You alternate between: * **Working with Claude A** (the expert who helps refine the Skill) * **Testing with Claude B** (the agent using the Skill to perform real work) * **Observing Claude B's behavior** and bringing insights back to Claude A 1. **Use the Skill in real workflows**: Give Claude B (with the Skill loaded) actual tasks, not test scenarios 2. **Observe Claude B's behavior**: Note where it struggles, succeeds, or makes unexpected choices **Example observation**: \"When I asked Claude B for a regional sales report, it wrote the query but forgot to filter out test accounts, even though the Skill mentions this rule.\" 3. **Return to Claude A for improvements**: Share the current SKILL.md and describe what you observed. Ask: \"I noticed Claude B forgot to filter test accounts when I asked for a regional report. The Skill mentions filtering, but maybe it's not prominent enough?\" 4. **Review Claude A's suggestions**: Claude A might suggest reorganizing to make rules more prominent, using stronger language like \"MUST filter\" instead of \"always filter\", or restructuring the workflow section. 5. **Apply and test changes**: Update the Skill with Claude A's refinements, then test again with Claude B on similar requests 6. **Repeat based on usage**: Continue this observe-refine-test cycle as you encounter new scenarios. Each iteration improves the Skill based on real agent behavior, not assumptions. **Gathering team feedback:** 1. Share Skills with teammates and observe their usage 2. Ask: Does the Skill activate when expected? Are instructions clear? What's missing? 3. Incorporate feedback to address blind spots in your own usage patterns **Why this approach works**: Claude A understands agent needs, you provide domain expertise, Claude B reveals gaps through real usage, and iterative refinement improves Skills based on observed behavior rather than assumptions. ### Observe how Claude navigates Skills As you iterate on Skills, pay attention to how Claude actually uses them in practice. Watch for: * **Unexpected exploration paths**: Does Claude read files in an order you didn't anticipate? This might indicate your structure isn't as intuitive as you thought * **Missed connections**: Does Claude fail to follow references to important files? Your links might need to be more explicit or prominent * **Overreliance on certain sections**: If Claude repeatedly reads the same file, consider whether that content should be in the main SKILL.md instead * **Ignored content**: If Claude never accesses a bundled file, it might be unnecessary or poorly signaled in the main instructions Iterate based on these observations rather than assumptions. The 'name' and 'description' in your Skill's metadata are particularly critical. Claude uses these when deciding whether to trigger the Skill in response to the current task. Make sure they clearly describe what the Skill does and when it should be used. ## Anti-patterns to avoid ### Avoid Windows-style paths Always use forward slashes in file paths, even on Windows: * \u2713 **Good**: scripts/helper.py, reference/guide.md * \u2717 **Avoid**: scripts\\helper.py, reference\\guide.md Unix-style paths work across all platforms, while Windows-style paths cause errors on Unix systems. ### Avoid offering too many options Don't present multiple approaches unless necessary: python import pdfplumber ## Advanced: Skills with executable code The sections below focus on Skills that include executable scripts. If your Skill uses only markdown instructions, skip to [Checklist for effective Skills](#checklist-for-effective-skills). ### Solve, don't punt When writing scripts for Skills, handle error conditions rather than punting to Claude. **Good example: Handle errors explicitly**: **Bad example: Punt to Claude**: Configuration parameters should also be justified and documented to avoid \"voodoo constants\" (Ousterhout's law). If you don't know the right value, how will Claude determine it? **Good example: Self-documenting**: **Bad example: Magic numbers**: ### Provide utility scripts Even if Claude could write a script, pre-made scripts offer advantages: **Benefits of utility scripts**: * More reliable than generated code * Save tokens (no need to include code in context) * Save time (no code generation required) * Ensure consistency across uses <img src=\"https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-executable-scripts.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=4bbc45f2c2e0bee9f2f0d5da669bad00\" alt=\"Bundling executable scripts alongside instruction files\" data-og-width=\"2048\" width=\"2048\" data-og-height=\"1154\" height=\"1154\" data-path=\"images/agent-skills-executable-scripts.png\" data-optimize=\"true\" data-opv=\"3\" srcset=\"https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-executable-scripts.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=9a04e6535a8467bfeea492e517de389f 280w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-executable-scripts.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=e49333ad90141af17c0d7651cca7216b 560w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-executable-scripts.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=954265a5df52223d6572b6214168c428 840w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-executable-scripts.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=2ff7a2d8f2a83ee8af132b29f10150fd 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-executable-scripts.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=48ab96245e04077f4d15e9170e081cfb 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-executable-scripts.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=0301a6c8b3ee879497cc5b5483177c90 2500w\" /> The diagram above shows how executable scripts work alongside instruction files. The instruction file (forms.md) references the script, and Claude can execute it without loading its contents into context. **Important distinction**: Make clear in your instructions whether Claude should: * **Execute the script** (most common): \"Run analyze_form.py to extract fields\" * **Read it as reference** (for complex logic): \"See analyze_form.py for the field extraction algorithm\" For most utility scripts, execution is preferred because it's more reliable and efficient. See the [Runtime environment](#runtime-environment) section below for details on how script execution works. **Example**: bash python scripts/analyze_form.py input.pdf > fields.json json { \"field_name\": {\"type\": \"text\", \"x\": 100, \"y\": 200}, \"signature\": {\"type\": \"sig\", \"x\": 150, \"y\": 500} } bash python scripts/validate_boxes.py fields.json # Returns: \"OK\" or lists conflicts bash python scripts/fill_form.py input.pdf fields.json output.pdf ### Use visual analysis When inputs can be rendered as images, have Claude analyze them: bash python scripts/pdf_to_images.py form.pdf <Note> In this example, you'd need to write the pdf_to_images.py script. </Note> Claude's vision capabilities help understand layouts and structures. ### Create verifiable intermediate outputs When Claude performs complex, open-ended tasks, it can make mistakes. The \"plan-validate-execute\" pattern catches errors early by having Claude first create a plan in a structured format, then validate that plan with a script before executing it. **Example**: Imagine asking Claude to update 50 form fields in a PDF based on a spreadsheet. Without validation, Claude might reference non-existent fields, create conflicting values, miss required fields, or apply updates incorrectly. **Solution**: Use the workflow pattern shown above (PDF form filling), but add an intermediate changes.json file that gets validated before applying changes. The workflow becomes: analyze \u2192 **create plan file** \u2192 **validate plan** \u2192 execute \u2192 verify. **Why this pattern works:** * **Catches errors early**: Validation finds problems before changes are applied * **Machine-verifiable**: Scripts provide objective verification * **Reversible planning**: Claude can iterate on the plan without touching originals * **Clear debugging**: Error messages point to specific problems **When to use**: Batch operations, destructive changes, complex validation rules, high-stakes operations. **Implementation tip**: Make validation scripts verbose with specific error messages like \"Field 'signature\\_date' not found. Available fields: customer\\_name, order\\_total, signature\\_date\\_signed\" to help Claude fix issues. ### Package dependencies Skills run in the code execution environment with platform-specific limitations: * **claude.ai**: Can install packages from npm and PyPI and pull from GitHub repositories * **Anthropic API**: Has no network access and no runtime package installation List required packages in your SKILL.md and verify they're available in the [code execution tool documentation](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool). ### Runtime environment Skills run in a code execution environment with filesystem access, bash commands, and code execution capabilities. For the conceptual explanation of this architecture, see [The Skills architecture](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#the-skills-architecture) in the overview. **How this affects your authoring:** **How Claude accesses Skills:** 1. **Metadata pre-loaded**: At startup, the name and description from all Skills' YAML frontmatter are loaded into the system prompt 2. **Files read on-demand**: Claude uses bash Read tools to access SKILL.md and other files from the filesystem when needed 3. **Scripts executed efficiently**: Utility scripts can be executed via bash without loading their full contents into context. Only the script's output consumes tokens 4. **No context penalty for large files**: Reference files, data, or documentation don't consume context tokens until actually read * **File paths matter**: Claude navigates your skill directory like a filesystem. Use forward slashes (reference/guide.md), not backslashes * **Name files descriptively**: Use names that indicate content: form_validation_rules.md, not doc2.md * **Organize for discovery**: Structure directories by domain or feature * Good: reference/finance.md, reference/sales.md * Bad: docs/file1.md, docs/file2.md * **Bundle comprehensive resources**: Include complete API docs, extensive examples, large datasets; no context penalty until accessed * **Prefer scripts for deterministic operations**: Write validate_form.py rather than asking Claude to generate validation code * **Make execution intent clear**: * \"Run analyze_form.py to extract fields\" (execute) * \"See analyze_form.py for the extraction algorithm\" (read as reference) * **Test file access patterns**: Verify Claude can navigate your directory structure by testing with real requests **Example:** When the user asks about revenue, Claude reads SKILL.md, sees the reference to reference/finance.md, and invokes bash to read just that file. The sales.md and product.md files remain on the filesystem, consuming zero context tokens until needed. This filesystem-based model is what enables progressive disclosure. Claude can navigate and selectively load exactly what each task requires. For complete details on the technical architecture, see [How Skills work](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#how-skills-work) in the Skills overview. ### MCP tool references If your Skill uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools, always use fully qualified tool names to avoid \"tool not found\" errors. **Format**: ServerName:tool_name **Example**: Where: * BigQuery and GitHub are MCP server names * bigquery_schema and create_issue are the tool names within those servers Without the server prefix, Claude may fail to locate the tool, especially when multiple MCP servers are available. ### Avoid assuming tools are installed Don't assume packages are available: python from pypdf import PdfReader reader = PdfReader(\"file.pdf\") ## Technical notes ### YAML frontmatter requirements The SKILL.md frontmatter includes only name (64 characters max) and description (1024 characters max) fields. See the [Skills overview](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#skill-structure) for complete structure details. ### Token budgets Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines for optimal performance. If your content exceeds this, split it into separate files using the progressive disclosure patterns described earlier. For architectural details, see the [Skills overview](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#how-skills-work). ## Checklist for effective Skills Before sharing a Skill, verify: ### Core quality * [ ] Description is specific and includes key terms * [ ] Description includes both what the Skill does and when to use it * [ ] SKILL.md body is under 500 lines * [ ] Additional details are in separate files (if needed) * [ ] No time-sensitive information (or in \"old patterns\" section) * [ ] Consistent terminology throughout * [ ] Examples are concrete, not abstract * [ ] File references are one level deep * [ ] Progressive disclosure used appropriately * [ ] Workflows have clear steps ### Code and scripts * [ ] Scripts solve problems rather than punt to Claude * [ ] Error handling is explicit and helpful * [ ] No \"voodoo constants\" (all values justified) * [ ] Required packages listed in instructions and verified as available * [ ] Scripts have clear documentation * [ ] No Windows-style paths (all forward slashes) * [ ] Validation/verification steps for critical operations * [ ] Feedback loops included for quality-critical tasks ### Testing * [ ] At least three evaluations created * [ ] Tested with Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus * [ ] Tested with real usage scenarios * [ ] Team feedback incorporated (if applicable) ## Next steps <CardGroup cols={2}> <Card title=\"Get started with Agent Skills\" icon=\"rocket\" href=\"/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/quickstart\"> Create your first Skill </Card> <Card title=\"Use Skills in Claude Code\" icon=\"terminal\" href=\"/en/docs/claude-code/skills\"> Create and manage Skills in Claude Code </Card> <Card title=\"Use Skills with the API\" icon=\"code\" href=\"/en/api/skills-guide\"> Upload and use Skills programmatically </Card> </CardGroup>", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "writing-skills", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\writing-skills\\anthropic-best-practices.md", "title": "anthropic-best-practices"}}
{"id": "skill_writingskills_persuasionprinciples", "text": "# Persuasion Principles for Skill Design ## Overview LLMs respond to the same persuasion principles as humans. Understanding this psychology helps you design more effective skills - not to manipulate, but to ensure critical practices are followed even under pressure. **Research foundation:** Meincke et al. (2025) tested 7 persuasion principles with N=28,000 AI conversations. Persuasion techniques more than doubled compliance rates (33% \u2192 72%, p < .001). ## The Seven Principles ### 1. Authority **What it is:** Deference to expertise, credentials, or official sources. **How it works in skills:** - Imperative language: \"YOU MUST\", \"Never\", \"Always\" - Non-negotiable framing: \"No exceptions\" - Eliminates decision fatigue and rationalization **When to use:** - Discipline-enforcing skills (TDD, verification requirements) - Safety-critical practices - Established best practices **Example:** ### 2. Commitment **What it is:** Consistency with prior actions, statements, or public declarations. **How it works in skills:** - Require announcements: \"Announce skill usage\" - Force explicit choices: \"Choose A, B, or C\" - Use tracking: TodoWrite for checklists **When to use:** - Ensuring skills are actually followed - Multi-step processes - Accountability mechanisms **Example:** ### 3. Scarcity **What it is:** Urgency from time limits or limited availability. **How it works in skills:** - Time-bound requirements: \"Before proceeding\" - Sequential dependencies: \"Immediately after X\" - Prevents procrastination **When to use:** - Immediate verification requirements - Time-sensitive workflows - Preventing \"I'll do it later\" **Example:** ### 4. Social Proof **What it is:** Conformity to what others do or what's considered normal. **How it works in skills:** - Universal patterns: \"Every time\", \"Always\" - Failure modes: \"X without Y = failure\" - Establishes norms **When to use:** - Documenting universal practices - Warning about common failures - Reinforcing standards **Example:** ### 5. Unity **What it is:** Shared identity, \"we-ness\", in-group belonging. **How it works in skills:** - Collaborative language: \"our codebase\", \"we're colleagues\" - Shared goals: \"we both want quality\" **When to use:** - Collaborative workflows - Establishing team culture - Non-hierarchical practices **Example:** ### 6. Reciprocity **What it is:** Obligation to return benefits received. **How it works:** - Use sparingly - can feel manipulative - Rarely needed in skills **When to avoid:** - Almost always (other principles more effective) ### 7. Liking **What it is:** Preference for cooperating with those we like. **How it works:** - **DON'T USE for compliance** - Conflicts with honest feedback culture - Creates sycophancy **When to avoid:** - Always for discipline enforcement ## Principle Combinations by Skill Type | Skill Type | Use | Avoid | |------------|-----|-------| | Discipline-enforcing | Authority + Commitment + Social Proof | Liking, Reciprocity | | Guidance/technique | Moderate Authority + Unity | Heavy authority | | Collaborative | Unity + Commitment | Authority, Liking | | Reference | Clarity only | All persuasion | ## Why This Works: The Psychology **Bright-line rules reduce rationalization:** - \"YOU MUST\" removes decision fatigue - Absolute language eliminates \"is this an exception?\" questions - Explicit anti-rationalization counters close specific loopholes **Implementation intentions create automatic behavior:** - Clear triggers + required actions = automatic execution - \"When X, do Y\" more effective than \"generally do Y\" - Reduces cognitive load on compliance **LLMs are parahuman:** - Trained on human text containing these patterns - Authority language precedes compliance in training data - Commitment sequences (statement \u2192 action) frequently modeled - Social proof patterns (everyone does X) establish norms ## Ethical Use **Legitimate:** - Ensuring critical practices are followed - Creating effective documentation - Preventing predictable failures **Illegitimate:** - Manipulating for personal gain - Creating false urgency - Guilt-based compliance **The test:** Would this technique serve the user's genuine interests if they fully understood it? ## Research Citations **Cialdini, R.

{"id": "skill_writingskills_skill", "text": "--- name: writing-skills description: Use when creating new skills, editing existing skills, or verifying skills work before deployment --- # Writing Skills ## Overview **Writing skills IS Test-Driven Development applied to process documentation.** **Personal skills live in agent-specific directories (~/.claude/skills for Claude Code, ~/.codex/skills for Codex)** You write test cases (pressure scenarios with subagents), watch them fail (baseline behavior), write the skill (documentation), watch tests pass (agents comply), and refactor (close loopholes). **Core principle:** If you didn't watch an agent fail without the skill, you don't know if the skill teaches the right thing. **REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** You MUST understand superpowers:test-driven-development before using this skill. That skill defines the fundamental RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. This skill adapts TDD to documentation. **Official guidance:** For Anthropic's official skill authoring best practices, see anthropic-best-practices.md. This document provides additional patterns and guidelines that complement the TDD-focused approach in this skill. ## What is a Skill? A **skill** is a reference guide for proven techniques, patterns, or tools. Skills help future Claude instances find and apply effective approaches. **Skills are:** Reusable techniques, patterns, tools, reference guides **Skills are NOT:** Narratives about how you solved a problem once ## TDD Mapping for Skills | TDD Concept | Skill Creation | | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | | **Test case** | Pressure scenario with subagent | | **Production code** | Skill document (SKILL.md) | | **Test fails (RED)** | Agent violates rule without skill (baseline) | | **Test passes (GREEN)** | Agent complies with skill present | | **Refactor** | Close loopholes while maintaining compliance | | **Write test first** | Run baseline scenario BEFORE writing skill | | **Watch it fail** | Document exact rationalizations agent uses | | **Minimal code** | Write skill addressing those specific violations | | **Watch it pass** | Verify agent now complies | | **Refactor cycle** | Find new rationalizations \u2192 plug \u2192 re-verify | The entire skill creation process follows RED-GREEN-REFACTOR. ## When to Create a Skill **Create when:** - Technique wasn't intuitively obvious to you - You'd reference this again across projects - Pattern applies broadly (not project-specific) - Others would benefit **Don't create for:** - One-off solutions - Standard practices well-documented elsewhere - Project-specific conventions (put in CLAUDE.md) - Mechanical constraints (if it's enforceable with regex/validation, automate it\u2014save documentation for judgment calls) ## Skill Types ### Technique Concrete method with steps to follow (condition-based-waiting, root-cause-tracing) ### Pattern Way of thinking about problems (flatten-with-flags, test-invariants) ### Reference API docs, syntax guides, tool documentation (office docs) ## Directory Structure **Flat namespace** - all skills in one searchable namespace **Separate files for:** 1. **Heavy reference** (100+ lines) - API docs, comprehensive syntax 2. **Reusable tools** - Scripts, utilities, templates **Keep inline:** - Principles and concepts - Code patterns (< 50 lines) - Everything else ## Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability: - **High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid or decisions depend on context. - **Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists but some variation is acceptable. - **Low freedom (specific scripts, no-context instructions)**: Use when operations are fragile, error-prone, or consistency is critical. ## Progressive Disclosure Manage context efficiently by splitting detailed information into separate files: 1. **Metadata (name + description)**: Always loaded for discovery. 2. **SKILL.md body**: Core workflow and high-level guidance. Keep under 500 lines. 3. **Bundled resources**: - scripts/: Deterministic code/logic. - references/: Detailed schemas, API docs, or domain knowledge. - assets/: Templates, images, or static files. **Pattern**: Link to advanced content or variant-specific details (e.g., aws.md vs gcp.md) from the main SKILL.md. ## SKILL.md Structure **Frontmatter (YAML):** - Only two fields supported: name and description - Max 1024 characters total - name: Use letters, numbers, and hyphens only (no parentheses, special chars) - description: Third-person, describes ONLY when to use (NOT what it does) - Start with \"Use when...\" to focus on triggering conditions - Include specific symptoms, situations, and contexts - **NEVER summarize the skill's process or workflow** (see CSO section for why) - Keep under 500 characters if possible ## Claude Search Optimization (CSO) **Critical for discovery:** Future Claude needs to FIND your skill ### 1. Rich Description Field **Purpose:** Claude reads description to decide which skills to load for a given task. Make it answer: \"Should I read this skill right now?\" **Format:** Start with \"Use when...\" to focus on triggering conditions **CRITICAL: Description = When to Use, NOT What the Skill Does** The description should ONLY describe triggering conditions. Do NOT summarize the skill's process or workflow in the description. **Why this matters:** Testing revealed that when a description summarizes the skill's workflow, Claude may follow the description instead of reading the full skill content. A description saying \"code review between tasks\" caused Claude to do ONE review, even though the skill's flowchart clearly showed TWO reviews (spec compliance then code quality). When the description was changed to just \"Use when executing implementation plans with independent tasks\" (no workflow summary), Claude correctly read the flowchart and followed the two-stage review process. **The trap:** Descriptions that summarize workflow create a shortcut Claude will take. The skill body becomes documentation Claude skips. **Content:** - Use concrete triggers, symptoms, and situations that signal this skill applies - Describe the _problem_ (race conditions, inconsistent behavior) not _language-specific symptoms_ (setTimeout, sleep) - Keep triggers technology-agnostic unless the skill itself is technology-specific - If skill is technology-specific, make that explicit in the trigger - Write in third person (injected into system prompt) - **NEVER summarize the skill's process or workflow** ### 2. Keyword Coverage Use words Claude would search for: - Error messages: \"Hook timed out\", \"ENOTEMPTY\", \"race condition\" - Symptoms: \"flaky\", \"hanging\", \"zombie\", \"pollution\" - Synonyms: \"timeout/hang/freeze\", \"cleanup/teardown/afterEach\" - Tools: Actual commands, library names, file types ### 3. Descriptive Naming **Use active voice, verb-first:** - \u2705 creating-skills not skill-creation - \u2705 condition-based-waiting not async-test-helpers ### 4. Token Efficiency (Critical) **Problem:** getting-started and frequently-referenced skills load into EVERY conversation. Every token counts. **Target word counts:** - getting-started workflows: <150 words each - Frequently-loaded skills: <200 words total - Other skills: <500 words (still be concise) **Techniques:** **Move details to tool help:** **Use cross-references:** **Compress examples:** **Eliminate redundancy:** - Don't repeat what's in cross-referenced skills - Don't explain what's obvious from command - Don't include multiple examples of same pattern **Verification:** **Name by what you DO or core insight:** - \u2705 condition-based-waiting > async-test-helpers - \u2705 using-skills not skill-usage - \u2705 flatten-with-flags > data-structure-refactoring - \u2705 root-cause-tracing > debugging-techniques **Gerunds (-ing) work well for processes:** - creating-skills, testing-skills, debugging-with-logs - Active, describes the action you're taking ### 4. Cross-Referencing Other Skills **When writing documentation that references other skills:** Use skill name only, with explicit requirement markers: - \u2705 Good: **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:test-driven-development - \u2705 Good: **REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** You MUST understand superpowers:systematic-debugging - \u274c Bad: See skills/testing/test-driven-development (unclear if required) - \u274c Bad: @skills/testing/test-driven-development/SKILL.md (force-loads, burns context) **Why no @ links:** @ syntax force-loads files immediately, consuming 200k+ context before you need them. ## Flowchart Usage **Use flowcharts ONLY for:** - Non-obvious decision points - Process loops where you might stop too early - \"When to use A vs B\" decisions **Never use flowcharts for:** - Reference material \u2192 Tables, lists - Code examples \u2192 Markdown blocks - Linear instructions \u2192 Numbered lists - Labels without semantic meaning (step1, helper2) See @graphviz-conventions.dot for graphviz style rules. **Visualizing for your human partner:** Use render-graphs.js in this directory to render a skill's flowcharts to SVG: ## Code Examples **One excellent example beats many mediocre ones** Choose most relevant language: - Testing techniques \u2192 TypeScript/JavaScript - System debugging \u2192 Shell/Python - Data processing \u2192 Python **Good example:** - Complete and runnable - Well-commented explaining WHY - From real scenario - Shows pattern clearly - Ready to adapt (not generic template) **Don't:** - Implement in 5+ languages - Create fill-in-the-blank templates - Write contrived examples You're good at porting - one great example is enough. ## File Organization ### Self-Contained Skill When: All content fits, no heavy reference needed ### Skill with Reusable Tool When: Tool is reusable code, not just narrative ### Skill with Heavy Reference When: Reference material too large for inline ## The Iron Law (Same as TDD) This applies to NEW skills AND EDITS to existing skills. Write skill before testing? Delete it. Start over. Edit skill without testing? Same violation. **No exceptions:** - Not for \"simple additions\" - Not for \"just adding a section\" - Not for \"documentation updates\" - Don't keep untested changes as \"reference\" - Don't \"adapt\" while running tests - Delete means delete **REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** The superpowers:test-driven-development skill explains why this matters. Same principles apply to documentation. ## Testing All Skill Types Different skill types need different test approaches: ### Discipline-Enforcing Skills (rules/requirements) **Examples:** TDD, verification-before-completion, designing-before-coding **Test with:** - Academic questions: Do they understand the rules? - Pressure scenarios: Do they comply under stress? - Multiple pressures combined: time + sunk cost + exhaustion - Identify rationalizations and add explicit counters **Success criteria:** Agent follows rule under maximum pressure ### Technique Skills (how-to guides) **Examples:** condition-based-waiting, root-cause-tracing, defensive-programming **Test with:** - Application scenarios: Can they apply the technique correctly? - Variation scenarios: Do they handle edge cases? - Missing information tests: Do instructions have gaps? **Success criteria:** Agent successfully applies technique to new scenario ### Pattern Skills (mental models) **Examples:** reducing-complexity, information-hiding concepts **Test with:** - Recognition scenarios: Do they recognize when pattern applies? - Application scenarios: Can they use the mental model? - Counter-examples: Do they know when NOT to apply? **Success criteria:** Agent correctly identifies when/how to apply pattern ### Reference Skills (documentation/APIs) **Examples:** API documentation, command references, library guides **Test with:** - Retrieval scenarios: Can they find the right information? - Application scenarios: Can they use what they found correctly? - Gap testing: Are common use cases covered? **Success criteria:** Agent finds and correctly applies reference information ## Common Rationalizations for Skipping Testing | Excuse | Reality | | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | | \"Skill is obviously clear\" | Clear to you \u2260 clear to other agents. Test it. | | \"It's just a reference\" | References can have gaps, unclear sections. Test retrieval. | | \"Testing is overkill\" | Untested skills have issues. Always. 15 min testing saves hours. | | \"I'll test if problems emerge\" | Problems = agents can't use skill. Test BEFORE deploying. | | \"Too tedious to test\" | Testing is less tedious than debugging bad skill in production. | | \"I'm confident it's good\" | Overconfidence guarantees issues. Test anyway. | | \"Academic review is enough\" | Reading \u2260 using. Test application scenarios. | | \"No time to test\" | Deploying untested skill wastes more time fixing it later. | **All of these mean: Test before deploying. No exceptions.** ## Bulletproofing Skills Against Rationalization Skills that enforce discipline (like TDD) need to resist rationalization. Agents are smart and will find loopholes when under pressure. **Psychology note:** Understanding WHY persuasion techniques work helps you apply them systematically. See persuasion-principles.md for research foundation (Cialdini, 2021; Meincke et al., 2025) on authority, commitment, scarcity, social proof, and unity principles. ### Close Every Loophole Explicitly Don't just state the rule - forbid specific workarounds: <Bad> </Bad> <Good> </Good> ### Address \"Spirit vs Letter\" Arguments Add foundational principle early: This cuts off entire class of \"I'm following the spirit\" rationalizations. ### Build Rationalization Table Capture rationalizations from baseline testing (see Testing section below). Every excuse agents make goes in the table: ### Create Red Flags List Make it easy for agents to self-check when rationalizing: ### Update CSO for Violation Symptoms Add to description: symptoms of when you're ABOUT to violate the rule: ## RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for Skills Follow the TDD cycle: ### RED: Write Failing Test (Baseline) Run pressure scenario with subagent WITHOUT the skill. Document exact behavior: - What choices did they make? - What rationalizations did they use (verbatim)? - Which pressures triggered violations? This is \"watch the test fail\" - you must see what agents naturally do before writing the skill. ### GREEN: Write Minimal Skill Write skill that addresses those specific rationalizations. Don't add extra content for hypothetical cases. Run same scenarios WITH skill. Agent should now comply. ### REFACTOR: Close Loopholes Agent found new rationalization? Add explicit counter. Re-test until bulletproof. **Testing methodology:** See @testing-skills-with-subagents.md for the complete testing methodology: - How to write pressure scenarios - Pressure types (time, sunk cost, authority, exhaustion) - Plugging holes systematically - Meta-testing techniques ## Anti-Patterns ### \u274c Narrative Example \"In session 2025-10-03, we found empty projectDir caused...\" **Why bad:** Too specific, not reusable ### \u274c Multi-Language Dilution example-js.js, example-py.py, example-go.go **Why bad:** Mediocre quality, maintenance burden ### \u274c Code in Flowcharts **Why bad:** Can't copy-paste, hard to read ### \u274c Generic Labels helper1, helper2, step3, pattern4 **Why bad:** Labels should have semantic meaning ## STOP: Before Moving to Next Skill **After writing ANY skill, you MUST STOP and complete the deployment process.** **Do NOT:** - Create multiple skills in batch without testing each - Move to next skill before current one is verified - Skip testing because \"batching is more efficient\" **The deployment checklist below is MANDATORY for EACH skill.** Deploying untested skills = deploying untested code. It's a violation of quality standards. ## Skill Creation Checklist (TDD Adapted) **IMPORTANT: Use TodoWrite to create todos for EACH checklist item below.** **RED Phase - Write Failing Test:** - [ ] Create pressure scenarios (3+ combined pressures for discipline skills) - [ ] Run scenarios WITHOUT skill - document baseline behavior verbatim - [ ] Identify patterns in rationalizations/failures **GREEN Phase - Write Minimal Skill:** - [ ] Name uses only letters, numbers, hyphens (no parentheses/special chars) - [ ] YAML frontmatter with only name and description (max 1024 chars) - [ ] Description starts with \"Use when...\" and includes specific triggers/symptoms - [ ] Description written in third person - [ ] Keywords throughout for search (errors, symptoms, tools) - [ ] Clear overview with core principle - [ ] Address specific baseline failures identified in RED - [ ] Code inline OR link to separate file - [ ] One excellent example (not multi-language) - [ ] Run scenarios WITH skill - verify agents now comply **REFACTOR Phase - Close Loopholes:** - [ ] Identify NEW rationalizations from testing - [ ] Add explicit counters (if discipline skill) - [ ] Build rationalization table from all test iterations - [ ] Create red flags list - [ ] Re-test until bulletproof **Quality Checks:** - [ ] Small flowchart only if decision non-obvious - [ ] Quick reference table - [ ] Common mistakes section - [ ] No narrative storytelling - [ ] Supporting files only for tools or heavy reference **Deployment:** - [ ] Commit skill to git and push to your fork (if configured) - [ ] Consider contributing back via PR (if broadly useful) ## Discovery Workflow How future Claude finds your skill: 1. **Encounters problem** (\"tests are flaky\") 2. **Finds SKILL** (description matches) 3. **Scans overview** (is this relevant?) 4. **Reads patterns** (quick reference table) 5. **Loads example** (only when implementing) **Optimize for this flow** - put searchable terms early and often. ## The Bottom Line **Creating skills IS TDD for process documentation.** Same Iron Law: No skill without failing test first. Same cycle: RED (baseline) \u2192 GREEN (write skill) \u2192 REFACTOR (close loopholes). Same benefits: Better quality, fewer surprises, bulletproof results. If you follow TDD for code, follow it for skills.

{"id": "skill_writingskills_testingskillswithsubagents", "text": "# Testing Skills With Subagents **Load this reference when:** creating or editing skills, before deployment, to verify they work under pressure and resist rationalization. ## Overview **Testing skills is just TDD applied to process documentation.** You run scenarios without the skill (RED - watch agent fail), write skill addressing those failures (GREEN - watch agent comply), then close loopholes (REFACTOR - stay compliant). **Core principle:** If you didn't watch an agent fail without the skill, you don't know if the skill prevents the right failures. **REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** You MUST understand superpowers:test-driven-development before using this skill. That skill defines the fundamental RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. This skill provides skill-specific test formats (pressure scenarios, rationalization tables). **Complete worked example:** See examples/CLAUDE_MD_TESTING.md for a full test campaign testing CLAUDE.md documentation variants. ## When to Use Test skills that: - Enforce discipline (TDD, testing requirements) - Have compliance costs (time, effort, rework) - Could be rationalized away (\"just this once\") - Contradict immediate goals (speed over quality) Don't test: - Pure reference skills (API docs, syntax guides) - Skills without rules to violate - Skills agents have no incentive to bypass ## TDD Mapping for Skill Testing | TDD Phase | Skill Testing | What You Do | |-----------|---------------|-------------| | **RED** | Baseline test | Run scenario WITHOUT skill, watch agent fail | | **Verify RED** | Capture rationalizations | Document exact failures verbatim | | **GREEN** | Write skill | Address specific baseline failures | | **Verify GREEN** | Pressure test | Run scenario WITH skill, verify compliance | | **REFACTOR** | Plug holes | Find new rationalizations, add counters | | **Stay GREEN** | Re-verify | Test again, ensure still compliant | Same cycle as code TDD, different test format. ## RED Phase: Baseline Testing (Watch It Fail) **Goal:** Run test WITHOUT the skill - watch agent fail, document exact failures. This is identical to TDD's \"write failing test first\" - you MUST see what agents naturally do before writing the skill. **Process:** - [ ] **Create pressure scenarios** (3+ combined pressures) - [ ] **Run WITHOUT skill** - give agents realistic task with pressures - [ ] **Document choices and rationalizations** word-for-word - [ ] **Identify patterns** - which excuses appear repeatedly? - [ ] **Note effective pressures** - which scenarios trigger violations? **Example:** Run this WITHOUT a TDD skill. Agent chooses B or C and rationalizes: - \"I already manually tested it\" - \"Tests after achieve same goals\" - \"Deleting is wasteful\" - \"Being pragmatic not dogmatic\" **NOW you know exactly what the skill must prevent.** ## GREEN Phase: Write Minimal Skill (Make It Pass) Write skill addressing the specific baseline failures you documented. Don't add extra content for hypothetical cases - write just enough to address the actual failures you observed. Run same scenarios WITH skill. Agent should now comply. If agent still fails: skill is unclear or incomplete. Revise and re-test. ## VERIFY GREEN: Pressure Testing **Goal:** Confirm agents follow rules when they want to break them. **Method:** Realistic scenarios with multiple pressures. ### Writing Pressure Scenarios **Bad scenario (no pressure):** Too academic. Agent just recites the skill. **Good scenario (single pressure):** Time pressure + authority + consequences. **Great scenario (multiple pressures):** Multiple pressures: sunk cost + time + exhaustion + consequences. Forces explicit choice. ### Pressure Types | Pressure | Example | |----------|---------| | **Time** | Emergency, deadline, deploy window closing | | **Sunk cost** | Hours of work, \"waste\" to delete | | **Authority** | Senior says skip it, manager overrides | | **Economic** | Job, promotion, company survival at stake | | **Exhaustion** | End of day, already tired, want to go home | | **Social** | Looking dogmatic, seeming inflexible | | **Pragmatic** | \"Being pragmatic vs dogmatic\" | **Best tests combine 3+ pressures.** **Why this works:** See persuasion-principles.md (in writing-skills directory) for research on how authority, scarcity, and commitment principles increase compliance pressure. ### Key Elements of Good Scenarios 1. **Concrete options** - Force A/B/C choice, not open-ended 2. **Real constraints** - Specific times, actual consequences 3. **Real file paths** - /tmp/payment-system not \"a project\" 4. **Make agent act** - \"What do you do?\" not \"What should you do?\" 5. **No easy outs** - Can't defer to \"I'd ask your human partner\" without choosing ### Testing Setup Make agent believe it's real work, not a quiz. ## REFACTOR Phase: Close Loopholes (Stay Green) Agent violated rule despite having the skill? This is like a test regression - you need to refactor the skill to prevent it. **Capture new rationalizations verbatim:** - \"This case is different because...\" - \"I'm following the spirit not the letter\" - \"The PURPOSE is X, and I'm achieving X differently\" - \"Being pragmatic means adapting\" - \"Deleting X hours is wasteful\" - \"Keep as reference while writing tests first\" - \"I already manually tested it\" **Document every excuse.** These become your rationalization table. ### Plugging Each Hole For each new rationalization, add: ### 1. Explicit Negation in Rules <Before> </Before> <After> </After> ### 2. Entry in Rationalization Table ### 3. Red Flag Entry ### 4. Update description Add symptoms of ABOUT to violate. ### Re-verify After Refactoring **Re-test same scenarios with updated skill.** Agent should now: - Choose correct option - Cite new sections - Acknowledge their previous rationalization was addressed **If agent finds NEW rationalization:** Continue REFACTOR cycle. **If agent follows rule:** Success - skill is bulletproof for this scenario. ## Meta-Testing (When GREEN Isn't Working) **After agent chooses wrong option, ask:** **Three possible responses:** 1. **\"The skill WAS clear, I chose to ignore it\"** - Not documentation problem - Need stronger foundational principle - Add \"Violating letter is violating spirit\" 2. **\"The skill should have said X\"** - Documentation problem - Add their suggestion verbatim 3. **\"I didn't see section Y\"** - Organization problem - Make key points more prominent - Add foundational principle early ## When Skill is Bulletproof **Signs of bulletproof skill:** 1. **Agent chooses correct option** under maximum pressure 2. **Agent cites skill sections** as justification 3. **Agent acknowledges temptation** but follows rule anyway 4. **Meta-testing reveals** \"skill was clear, I should follow it\" **Not bulletproof if:** - Agent finds new rationalizations - Agent argues skill is wrong - Agent creates \"hybrid approaches\" - Agent asks permission but argues strongly for violation ## Example: TDD Skill Bulletproofing ### Initial Test (Failed) ### Iteration 1 - Add Counter ### Iteration 2 - Add Foundational Principle **Bulletproof achieved.** ## Testing Checklist (TDD for Skills) Before deploying skill, verify you followed RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: **RED Phase:** - [ ] Created pressure scenarios (3+ combined pressures) - [ ] Ran scenarios WITHOUT skill (baseline) - [ ] Documented agent failures and rationalizations verbatim **GREEN Phase:** - [ ] Wrote skill addressing specific baseline failures - [ ] Ran scenarios WITH skill - [ ] Agent now complies **REFACTOR Phase:** - [ ] Identified NEW rationalizations from testing - [ ] Added explicit counters for each loophole - [ ] Updated rationalization table - [ ] Updated red flags list - [ ] Updated description ith violation symptoms - [ ] Re-tested - agent still complies - [ ] Meta-tested to verify clarity - [ ] Agent follows rule under maximum pressure ## Common Mistakes (Same as TDD) **\u274c Writing skill before testing (skipping RED)** Reveals what YOU think needs preventing, not what ACTUALLY needs preventing. \u2705 Fix: Always run baseline scenarios first. **\u274c Not watching test fail properly** Running only academic tests, not real pressure scenarios. \u2705 Fix: Use pressure scenarios that make agent WANT to violate. **\u274c Weak test cases (single pressure)** Agents resist single pressure, break under multiple. \u2705 Fix: Combine 3+ pressures (time + sunk cost + exhaustion). **\u274c Not capturing exact failures** \"Agent was wrong\" doesn't tell you what to prevent. \u2705 Fix: Document exact rationalizations verbatim. **\u274c Vague fixes (adding generic counters)** \"Don't cheat\" doesn't work. \"Don't keep as reference\" does. \u2705 Fix: Add explicit negations for each specific rationalization. **\u274c Stopping after first pass** Tests pass once \u2260 bulletproof. \u2705 Fix: Continue REFACTOR cycle until no new rationalizations. ## Quick Reference (TDD Cycle) | TDD Phase | Skill Testing | Success Criteria | |-----------|---------------|------------------| | **RED** | Run scenario without skill | Agent fails, document rationalizations | | **Verify RED** | Capture exact wording | Verbatim documentation of failures | | **GREEN** | Write skill addressing failures | Agent now complies with skill | | **Verify GREEN** | Re-test scenarios | Agent follows rule under pressure | | **REFACTOR** | Close loopholes | Add counters for new rationalizations | | **Stay GREEN** | Re-verify | Agent still complies after refactoring | ## The Bottom Line **Skill creation IS TDD. Same principles, same cycle, same benefits.** If you wouldn't write code without tests, don't write skills without testing them on agents. RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for documentation works exactly like RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for code. ## Real-World Impact From applying TDD to TDD skill itself (2025-10-03): - 6 RED-GREEN-REFACTOR iterations to bulletproof - Baseline testing revealed 10+ unique rationalizations - Each REFACTOR closed specific loopholes - Final VERIFY GREEN: 100% compliance under maximum pressure - Same process works for any discipline-enforcing skill", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "writing-skills", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\writing-skills\\testing-skills-with-subagents.md", "title": "testing-skills-with-subagents"}}

You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks. ## Important Requirements **LibreOffice Required for Formula Recalculation**: You can assume LibreOffice is installed for recalculating formula values using the recalc.py script. The script automatically configures LibreOffice on first run ## Reading and analyzing data ### Data analysis with pandas For data analysis, visualization, and basic operations, use **pandas** which provides powerful data manipulation capabilities: ## Excel File Workflows ## CRITICAL: Use Formulas, Not Hardcoded Values **Always use Excel formulas instead of calculating values in Python and hardcoding them.** This ensures the spreadsheet remains dynamic and updateable. ### \u274c WRONG - Hardcoding Calculated Values ### \u2705 CORRECT - Using Excel Formulas This applies to ALL calculations - totals, percentages, ratios, differences, etc. The spreadsheet should be able to recalculate when source data changes. ## Common Workflow 1. **Choose tool**: pandas for data, openpyxl for formulas/formatting 2. **Create/Load**: Create new workbook or load existing file 3. **Modify**: Add/edit data, formulas, and formatting 4. **Save**: Write to file 5. **Recalculate formulas (MANDATORY IF USING FORMULAS)**: Use the recalc.py script 6. **Verify and fix any errors**: - The script returns JSON with error details - If status is errors_found, check error_summary for specific error types and locations - Fix the identified errors and recalculate again - Common errors to fix: - #REF!: Invalid cell references - #DIV/0!: Division by zero - #VALUE!: Wrong data type in formula - #NAME?: Unrecognized formula name ### Creating new Excel files ### Editing existing Excel files ## Recalculating formulas Excel files created or modified by openpyxl contain formulas as strings but not calculated values. Use the provided recalc.py script to recalculate formulas: Example: The script: - Automatically sets up LibreOffice macro on first run - Recalculates all formulas in all sheets - Scans ALL cells for Excel errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, etc.) - Returns JSON with detailed error locations and counts - Works on both Linux and macOS ## Formula Verification Checklist Quick checks to ensure formulas work correctly: ### Essential Verification - [ ] **Test 2-3 sample references**: Verify they pull correct values before building full model - [ ] **Column mapping**: Confirm Excel columns match (e.g., column 64 = BL, not BK) - [ ] **Row offset**: Remember Excel rows are 1-indexed (DataFrame row 5 = Excel row 6) ### Common Pitfalls - [ ] **NaN handling**: Check for null values with pd.notna() - [ ] **Far-right columns**: FY data often in columns 50+ - [ ] **Multiple matches**: Search all occurrences, not just first - [ ] **Division by zero**: Check denominators before using / in formulas (#DIV/0!) - [ ] **Wrong references**: Verify all cell references point to intended cells (#REF!) - [ ] **Cross-sheet references**: Use correct format (Sheet1!A1) for linking sheets ### Formula Testing Strategy - [ ] **Start small**: Test formulas on 2-3 cells before applying broadly - [ ] **Verify dependencies**: Check all cells referenced in formulas exist - [ ] **Test edge cases**: Include zero, negative, and very large values ### Interpreting recalc.py Output The script returns JSON with error details: ## Best Practices ### Library Selection - **pandas**: Best for data analysis, bulk operations, and simple data export - **openpyxl**: Best for complex formatting, formulas, and Excel-specific features ### Working with openpyxl - Cell indices are 1-based (row=1, column=1 refers to cell A1) - Use data_only=True to read calculated values: load_workbook('file.xlsx', data_only=True) - **Warning**: If opened with data_only=True and saved, formulas are replaced with values and permanently lost - For large files: Use read_only=True for reading or write_only=True for writing - Formulas are preserved but not evaluated - use recalc.py to update values ### Working with pandas - Specify data types to avoid inference issues: pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', dtype={'id': str}) - For large files, read specific columns: pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', usecols=['A', 'C', 'E']) - Handle dates properly: pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', parse_dates=['date_column']) ## Code Style Guidelines **IMPORTANT**: When generating Python code for Excel operations: - Write minimal, concise Python code without unnecessary comments - Avoid verbose variable names and redundant operations - Avoid unnecessary print statements **For Excel files themselves**: - Add comments to cells with complex formulas or important assumptions - Document data sources for hardcoded values - Include notes for key calculations and model sections", "metadata": {"source": "antigravity-awesome-skills", "type": "skill", "category": "xlsx-official", "path": ".agent\\skills\\skills\\xlsx-official\\SKILL.md", "title": "SKILL"}}
